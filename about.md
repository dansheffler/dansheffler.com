## About ##

<img style="float: right;" src="https://www.dansheffler.com/files/ProfileSmall.jpg" />I am Dan Sheffler, a philosopher who specializes in ancient Greek and early Christian thought.  I am passionate about classical education, and I write about topics such as beauty, virtue, truth, education, and sanctity.  If you are looking for a full CV you can find mine [here](http://dansheffler.com/cv/).  Alongside my academic work, I am also the director of a [Christian Training School](http://www.ucfky.com/cts/) during the summer.

I am married with three children, I love to read, to write, to hike, and to worship with my friends at church.

I created this site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) so that I could have complete control over the content I post online and so that I could do everything with [markdown](http://whatismarkdown.com/).  You can see the innards of the site by looking at [its Github repository](https://github.com/dansheffler/dansheffler.com).

You can contact me at daniel_sheffler at georgetowncollege dot edu.
