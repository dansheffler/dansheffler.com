## About ##

<img style="float: right;" src="http://www.dansheffler.com/files/ProfileSmall.jpg" />I am Dan Sheffler, a philosopher who specializes in ancient Greek and early Christian thought.  If you are looking for a full CV you can find mine [here](http://dansheffler.com/cv/).  Alongside my academic work, I am also the director of a [Christian Training School](http://www.ucf.cfchurches.com/christian-training-school/) during the summer.

I am married with three children, I love to read, and I am interested in both video games and table-top games.

I created this site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) so that I could have complete control over the content I post online and so that I could do everything with [markdown](http://whatismarkdown.com/).  You can see the innards of the site by looking at [its Github repository](https://github.com/dansheffler/dansheffler.com).
