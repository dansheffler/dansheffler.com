# What is Philosophy #

## Asking the Big Questions ##

<aside class=notes>
Rauhut gives a nice example of a tribal girl asking her father about the nature of the stars and whether they care about us.  Spend a little bit of time talking about other kinds of questions that are similarly "big."
</aside>

## Worldview ##

<aside class=notes>
Talk about the concept of "Worldview" as comprehensive answers to the big questions.
</aside>


# Stories #

## Mythologies ##

<aside class=notes>
- Do mythological stories provide satisfactory answers to the big questions?
</aside>

## But is it all True? ##

<aside class=notes>
- Is there any reason to think that some of these stories are true?
- Can they be ultimately satisfactory answers if they arn't true?
- How would someone go about beginning to figure whether they were true or not.
</aside>

## Other Narratives ##

<aside class=notes>
Aside from traditional mythologies (of the sort found in Bulfinch's), we also have a great many "narratives" that we use to form a comprehensive picture of the world.  We can ask the same truth questions about these.

**This is where reading 1.1 stops**
</aside>


# Religious Explanation #

## Based on Revelation ##

<aside class=notes>
- As Rauhut points out, this gives us one big reason to think that
  religious explanations, unlike generic mythologies are *true*.
- Ask: So does this change the game?  Would a story or explanation
  based on the authority of divine revelation be better or more
  powerful at explaining the world?
</aside>

## Competition? ##

<aside class=notes>
- So say we have two claims to divine revelation that contradict
  one another.  Ask: is there any way to decide between the two?
- Could we appeal to further divine revelation at this point?
</aside>

# Philosophy #

<aside class=notes>
Mention again: Philosophy as love of wisdom.
</aside>

## Big-Picture Answers ##

<aside class=notes>
- One possible response students have at this point is to simply
  try to give up on the project of providing big-picture answers.
- Philosophy doesn't give up.
- Ask: are we justified in continueing to try to provide big-
  picture answers?
- Ask: Isn't this the source of wars and big fight?  Perhaps we
  should just all agree to disagree?
</aside>

## Arguments ##

## Overlap ##

<aside class=notes>
- Stress that these are not exhaustive categories, either with each
  other or with philosophy.  One can ask religious questions or
  attempt to give religious truths by telling stories.  One can
  also ask philosophical questions about things based on divine
  revelation or try to figure things out about God based on
  reasons.
- Perhaps mention that Tolstoy, after having the experiences Rauhut
  mentions, arrives at a radically religious worldview.
- **This is where reading 1.2 stops**
