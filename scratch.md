Insights develop from connections between ideas.  Because my computer notes are arranged topically I generate many content-driven connections between ideas, but one important type of connection is lost: chronological association.  Because my notebook is a straight chronological stream, I can immediately situate a note made on Plato's *Republic* between a comment from a lecture on the philosophy of time and some reflections the nature of consciousness.  These otherwise disparate subjects are connected *for me* because my thoughts on them all occur on the same day of *my* life.  If the straight chronological format were all I did, the organization of my notes would be quite limited, but because I utilize both systems I get the best of both.

I capitalize on this chronological structure when I want to put a reference to a passage in my computer notes.  Every reference looks like this `<J2014-07-28>`.  The `J` stands for "journal" and the date tells me exactly where to look while also associating that reference with other chronologically near-by references.
