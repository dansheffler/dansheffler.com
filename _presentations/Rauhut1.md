## Asking the Big Questions ##

<aside class=notes>
Rauhut gives a nice example of a tribal girl asking her father about the nature of the stars and whether they care about us.  Spend a little bit of time talking about other kinds of questions that are similarly "big."

## Worldview ##

<aside class=notes>
Talk about the concept of "Worldview" as comprehensive answers to the big questions.

## Stories ##

</section>
<section>

## Mythologies ##

<aside class=notes>
- Do mythological stories provide satisfactory answers to the big questions?
</aside>
</section>
<section>

## But is it all True? ##

<aside class=notes>
- Is there any reason to think that some of these stories are true?
- Can they be ultimately satisfactory answers if they arn't true?
- How would someone go about beginning to figure whether they were true or not.
</aside>

</section>
<section>

## Other Narratives ##

<aside class=notes>
Aside from traditional mythologies (of the sort found in Bulfinch's), we also have a great many "narratives" that we use to form a comprehensive picture of the world.  We can ask the same truth questions about these.

# Religious Explanation and Philosophy #

</section>
<section>

## Based on Revelation ##

<aside class=notes>
- As Rauhut points out, this gives us one big reason to think that
  religious explanations, unlike generic mythologies are *true*.
- Ask: So does this change the game?  Would a story or explanation
  based on the authority of divine revelation be better or more
  powerful at explaining the world?
</aside>

</section>
<section>

## Competition? ##

<aside class=notes>
- So say we have two claims to divine revelation that contradict
  one another.  Ask: is there any way to decide between the two?
- Could we appeal to further divine revelation at this point?
</aside>

</section>
<section>

## Philosophy ##

<aside class=notes>
Mention again: Philosophy as love of wisdom.
</aside>

</section>
<section>

## Similarity: Big-Picture Answers ##

<aside class=notes>
- One possible response students have at this point is to simply
  try to give up on the project of providing big-picture answers.
- Philosophy doesn't give up.
- Ask: are we justified in continueing to try to provide big-
  picture answers?
- Ask: Isn't this the source of wars and big fight?  Perhaps we
  should just all agree to disagree?
</aside>

</section>
<section>

## Based on Arguments ##

</section>
<section>

## Reflection Question #1 ##

> Religion and philosophy use different methods of explaining the
> world.  Philosophy uses reason, and religion uses revelation to
> explain events.  Does this mean that religion and philosophy have
> to be at odds with each other?  Can the truths of reason be
> identical with the truths of revelation?  Explain.

<aside class=notes>
- Perhaps do a five minute essay at the end of class.  Or just
  discuss it.
- Perhaps mention that Tolstoy, after having the experiences Rauhut
  mentions, arrives at a radically religious worldview.

# Philosophy and Dialogue #

</section>

## [Rebeca Newberger Goldstein](https://www.closertotruth.com/series/asking-ultimate-questions#video-47354) ##

</section>
<section>

## Responding to Challenges ##

<aside class=notes>
- How do you respond when someone asks a challenging question about
  some of your fundamental beliefs?
- How *should* someone respond when asked such a question?
</aside>

</section>
<section>

## Conflict Between Arguments ##

<aside class=notes>
- Recall that Rauhut brought in reason precisely as a way to deal
  with conflict between claims to divine revelation.
- Are we now in any better position with argumentation, given that
  there seems to be no end to the conflicting arguments?
- Perhaps we should *now* give up?
- Point out that argumentation is in a slightly different position:
  when conflict arises, argumentation can appeal to its own
  standards, whereas in widely divergent claims to revelation there
  is no common point of appeal.
</aside>
</section>
<section>

## Dangerous? ##

<aside class=notes>
- Is doing philosophy all good?
- Does the critical process open you up to certain dangers?
- Perhaps these are not always worth it.
</aside>

</section>
<section data-background="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Socrates_Louvre.jpg">

> The unexamined life is not worth living for a human being.\

---Socrates, *Apology*, 38a

<aside class=notes>
- Ask why adding "for a human being" is important here.

<section data-background="http://www.military-history.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Wittgenstein.jpg">

> Even when all possible scientific problems have been answered,
> the problems of life have not been put to rest.

---Ludwig Wittgenstein, *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*, Proposition 6.52

</section>
<section>

## Souls as an Example ##

<aside class=notes>
- Asking whether we have a soul or not is a good example of a
  philosophical rather than scientific question.
- Ask how we would even go about answering the question whether we
  have a soul or not.
- Would any physical experiment ever help?
</aside>
</section>
<section>

## No Quick Test ##

<aside class=notes>
- Many scientific questions are answerable just by doing a quick
  test.  How much mass does X have?  Well put it in the scale.
- Can we think of some other questions that cannot be settled just
  by performing a test?
</aside>
</section>
<section>

## Numbers Example ##

<aside class=notes>
- Mathematicians tell us lots *about* numbers, but they rarely stop
  to ask, "What *are* numbers anyway?"
- So what let's talk about it: what *are* numbers anyway?
</aside>
</section>
<section>

## Blurry Borders ##

<aside class=notes>
- Perhaps discuss some of the FFT questions on page 9.
</aside>
</section>
<section>

## Reflection Question #4 ##

> Science is not able to answer every question that we have about
> our lives.  For example, no scientific discipline can answer the
> question What is the meaning of life?  In your opinion, are such
> open questions meaningful?  Should we assume that only questions
> easily answered by science are meaningful, and that all remaining
> open questions are of no value without clear meaning?  If we
> follow this life of though, we arrive at the conclusion that
> science---although not able to answer all questions---can answer
> all meaningful questions.  Do you agree with this conclusion?
> Why or why not?

<section>

## Role of Experience ##

<aside class=notes>
- Two people might weigh evidence differently based on their own
  experiences.
- Does this mean that truth is relative?
</aside>

</section>
<section>

## Intellectual Humility ##

<aside class=notes>
- Although it might seem frustrating, learning that you don't know
  what you once thought you knew is actually a kind of progress.
- Ask about experiences that students have had where this has
  happened and it has been good.
- Also ask about experiences where students have pressed through a
  period of ignorance to actually come to new firm convictions?
- Are these different from or the same as the place where they
  began?
</aside>
</section>
<section>

## Food for Thought ##

<aside class=notes>
Consider using numbers 1, 4, 5, 9, 14, and 15 as time allows.
