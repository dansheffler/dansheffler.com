# Rauhut Chapter 1 #

## What is Philosophy ##



</section>
<section>

## Asking the Big Questions ##

<aside class=notes>
Rauhut gives a nice example of a tribal girl asking her father about the nature of the stars and whether they care about us.  Spend a little bit of time talking about other kinds of questions that are similarly "big."
</aside>

</section>
<section>

## Worldview ##

<aside class=notes>
Talk about the concept of "Worldview" as comprehensive answers to the big questions.
</aside>
</section>
<section><!--Begin Stories-->

<section>

# Stories #

</section>
<section>

## Mythologies ##

<aside class=notes>
- Do mythological stories provide satisfactory answers to the big questions?
</aside>
</section>
<section>

## But is it all True? ##

<aside class=notes>
- Is there any reason to think that some of these stories are true?
- Can they be ultimately satisfactory answers if they arn't true?
- How would someone go about beginning to figure whether they were true or not.
</aside>

</section>
<section>

## Other Narratives ##

<aside class=notes>
Aside from traditional mythologies (of the sort found in Bulfinch's), we also have a great many "narratives" that we use to form a comprehensive picture of the world.  We can ask the same truth questions about these.

**This is where reading 1.1 stops**
</aside>

</section>
</section><!--End Stories-->
<section><!--Begin Religion-->

<section>

# Religious Explanation #

</section>
<section>

## Based on Revelation ##

<aside class=notes>
- As Rauhut points out, this gives us one big reason to think that
  religious explanations, unlike generic mythologies are *true*.
- Ask: So does this change the game?  Would a story or explanation
  based on the authority of divine revelation be better or more
  powerful at explaining the world?
</aside>

</section>
<section>

## Mysticism ##

<aside class=notes>
I want to add to Rauhut's account a fourth possibility, "mysticism," for lack of a better term, that relies on direct experiences of some kind of "enlightenment."  This may or may not be understood as revelation from God, but the linking feature is that it is experienced first hand rather than transmitted through tradition and it is some kind of extraordinary cognitive experience.
</aside>
</section>
<section>

## Competition? ##

<aside class=notes>
- So say we have two claims to divine revelation that contradict
  one another.  Ask: is there any way to decide between the two?
- Could we appeal to further divine revelation at this point?
</aside>

</section>
</section><!--End Religion-->
<section><!--Begin Philosophy-->
<section>

# Philosophy #

<aside class=notes>
Mention again: Philosophy as love of wisdom.
</aside>

</section>
<section>

## Big-Picture Answers ##

<aside class=notes>
- One possible response students have at this point is to simply
  try to give up on the project of providing big-picture answers.
- Philosophy doesn't give up.
- Ask: are we justified in continueing to try to provide big-
  picture answers?
- Ask: Isn't this the source of wars and big fight?  Perhaps we
  should just all agree to disagree?
</aside>

## Arguments ##

</section>
<section>

## Reflection Question #1 ##

> Religion and philosophy use different methods of explaining the
> world.  Philosophy uses reason, and religion uses revelation to
> explain events.  Does this mean that religion and philosophy have
> to be at odds with each other?  Can the truths of reason be
> identical with the truths of revelation?  Explain.

<aside class=notes>
- Perhaps do a five minute essay at the end of class.  Or just
  discuss it.
- Perhaps mention that Tolstoy, after having the experiences Rauhut
  mentions, arrives at a radically religious worldview.
- **This is where reading 1.2 stops**

# Philosophy and Dialogue #

</section>
<section>

## Responding to Challenges ##

<aside class=notes>
- How do you respond when someone asks a challenging question about
  some of your fundamental beliefs?
- How *should* someone respond when asked such a question?
</aside>

</section>
<section>

## Conflict Between Arguments ##

<aside class=notes>
- Recall that Rauhut brought in reason precisely as a way to deal
  with conflict between claims to divine revelation.
- Are we now in any better position with argumentation, given that
  there seems to be no end to the conflicting arguments?
- Perhaps we should *now* give up?
- Point out that argumentation is in a slightly different position:
  when conflict arises, argumentation can appeal to its own
  standards, whereas in widely divergent claims to revelation there
  is no common point of appeal.
</aside>
</section>
<section>

## Dangerous? ##

<aside class=notes>
- Is doing philosophy all good?
- Does the critical process open you up to certain dangers?
- Perhaps these are not always worth it.

<section data-background="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Socrates_Louvre.jpg">

> The unexamined life is not worth living for a human being.\

---Socrates, *Apology*, 38a

<aside class=notes>
- Ask why adding "for a human being" is important here.
- **This is where reading 1.3 stops**

# Philosophy and Science #

<section data-background="http://www.military-history.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Wittgenstein.jpg">

> Even when all possible scientific problems have been answered,
> the problems of life have not been put to rest.

---Ludwig Wittgenstein, *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*, Proposition 6.52

<section>

## Souls as an Example ##

<aside class=notes>
- Asking whether we have a soul or not is a good example of a
  philosophical rather than scientific question.
- Ask how we would even go about answering the question whether we
  have a soul or not.
- Would any physical experiment ever help?
</aside>
</section>
<section>

## No Quick Test ##

<aside class=notes>
- Many scientific questions are answerable just by doing a quick
  test.  How much mass does X have?  Well put it in the scale.
- Can we think of some other questions that cannot be settled just
  by performing a test?
</aside>
</section>
<section>

## Numbers Example ##

<aside class=notes>
- Mathematicians tell us lots *about* numbers, but they rarely stop
  to ask, "What *are* numbers anyway?"
- So what let's talk about it: what *are* numbers anyway?
</aside>

</section>

</section>
<section>

## Blurry Borders ##

<aside class=notes>
- Perhaps discuss some of the FFT questions on page 9.
</aside>
</section>
<section>

## Reflection Question #4 ##

> Science is not able to answer every question that we have about
> our lives.  For example, no scientific discipline can answer the
> question What is the meaning of life?  In your opinion, are such
> open questions meaningful?  Should we assume that only questions
> easily answered by science are meaningful, and that all remaining
> open questions are of no value without clear meaning?  If we
> follow this life of though, we arrive at the conclusion that
> science---although not able to answer all questions---can answer
> all meaningful questions.  Do you agree with this conclusion?
> Why or why not?

## Role of Experience ##

<aside class=notes>
- Two people might weigh evidence differently based on their own
  experiences.
- Does this mean that truth is relative?
</aside>

</section>
<section>

## Intellectual Humility ##

<aside class=notes>
- Although it might seem frustrating, learning that you don't know
  what you once thought you knew is actually a kind of progress.
- Ask about experiences that students have had where this has
  happened and it has been good.
- Also ask about experiences where students have pressed through a
  period of ignorance to actually come to new firm convictions?
- Are these different from or the same as the place where they
  began?

## Food for Thought ##

<aside class=notes>
Consider using numbers 1, 4, 5, 9, 14, and 15 as time allows.
