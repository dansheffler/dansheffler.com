## The Principle of Utility ##

(AKA Bentham's "Greatest Happiness Principle")

# Chapter 2, pp. 6--14 #

<section>

## What is Utility? ##

> [Utility is] not something contradistinguished from pleasure, but
> pleasure itself, together with exemption from pain.
> (Ch. 2, p. 6)

</section>
<section>

## The Principle Spelled Out ##

> The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals "utility" or
> the "greatest happiness principle" holds that actions are right
> in proportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong as they
> tend to promote the reverse of happiness.  By happiness is
> indented pleasure and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain
> and the privation of pleasure.
> (Ch. 2, p. 7)

</section>
<section>

## Ultimate Desirability ##

> Pleasure and freedom from pain are the only things desirable as
> ends.
> (Ch. 2, p. 7)

- Technical term: **Hedonism**

</section>
<section>

## Human Happiness ##

> The comparison of the Epicurean life to that of beasts is felt as
> degrading, precisely because a beast's pleasures do not satisfy a
> human being's conception of happiness.
> (Ch. 2, p. 8)

</section>
<section>

## Unequal *Kinds* of Pleasure ##

> Some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than
> others.  It would be absurd that, while in estimating all other
> things quality is considered as well as quantity, the estimation
> of pleasure should be supposed to depend on quantity alone.
> (Ch. 2, p. 8)

</section>
<section>

## Pigs and Fools ##

> It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig
> satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool
> satisfied.  And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different
> opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the
> question.  The other party to the comparison knows both sides.

</section>
<section>

## Everyone's Happiness ##

> [The utilitarian standard] is not the agent's own greatest
> happiness, but the greatest amount of happiness altogether.

# Chapter 2, pp. 15--21 #

</section>
<section>

## Self-Sacrifice ##

> The utilitarian morality does recognize in human beings the power
> of sacrificing their own greatest good for the good of others.
> It only refuses to admit that the sacrifice is itself a good.
> (Ch. 2, pp. 16--17)

</section>
<section>

## The Golden Rule ##

</section>
<section>

## Motives ##

> It is the business of ethics to tell us what are our duties, or
> by what test we may know them; but no system of ethics requires
> that the sole motive of all we do shall be a feeling of duty.
> (Ch. 2, pp. 18)

(Actually Kant's system requires exactly this.)

</section>
<section>

> Utilitarian moralists have gone beyond almost all others in
> affirming that the motive has nothing to do with the morality of
> the action, though much with the worth of the agent.
> (Ch. 2, pp. 18)

</section>
<section>

## Virtue ##

> No known ethical standard decides an action to be good or bad
> because it is done by a good or bad man, still less because done
> by an amiable, a brave, or a benevolent man, or the contrary.
> These considerations are relevant, not to the estimation of
> actions, but of persons.
> (Ch. 2, p. 20)

(Actually, virtue ethics might do just this.)

## Utilitarianism and Christianity ##

</section>
<section>

## Ethical Dilemmas ##

> If the principle of utility is good for anything, it must be good
> for weighing these conflicting utilities against one another and
> marking out the region within which one or the other
> preponderates.
> (Ch. 2, p. 23)

</section>
<section>

## How do we Calculate? ##

> Defenders of utility often find themselves called upon to reply
> to such objections as this---that there is not time, previous to
> action, for calculating and weighing the effects of any line of
> conduct on the general happiness.
> (Ch. 2, p. 23)

</section>
<section>

## Traditional Morality ##

> Mankind must by this time have acquired positive beliefs as to
> the effects of some actions on their happiness; and the beliefs
> which have thus come down are the rules of morality for the
> multitude, and for the philosopher until he has succeeded in
> finding better.
> (Ch. 2, p. 24)

<section>

## External versus Internal Sanctions ##

</section>
<section>

## Subjective Feeling and Objective Belief ##

</section>
<section>

## Innate versus Acquired Moral Feeling ##

</section>
<section>

## Social Feeling ##

> The social state is at once so natural, so necessary, and so
> habitual to man, that, except in some unusual circumstances or by
> an effort of voluntary abstraction, he never conceives himself
> otherwise than as a member of a body; and this association is
> riveted more and more, as mankind are further removed from the
> state of savage independence.
> (Ch. 3, p. 32)

</section>
<section>

## Equality ##

> Society between equals can only exist on the understanding that
> the interests of all are to be regarded equally.
> (Ch. 3, p. 32)

# Chapter 4 #

</section>
<section>

## Desirability ##

> Questions about ends are, in other words, questions what things
> are desirable.  The utilitarian doctrine is that happiness is
> desirable, and the only thing desirable, as an end; all other
> things being only desirable as means to that end.  What ought to
> be required of this doctrine, what conditions is it requisite
> that the doctrine should fulfill---to make good its claim to be
> believed?
> (Ch. 4, p. 35)

</section>
<section>

## The Proof ##

> The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible
> is that people actually see it.  The only proof that a sound is
> audible is that people hear it; and so of the other sources of
> our exerpience.  In like manner, I apprehend, the sole evidence
> it is possible to produce that anything is desirable is that
> people do actually desire it.
> (Ch. 4, p. 35)

</section>
<section>

## Love of Money Example ##

</section>
<section>

## Cultivation of Virtue ##

> The utilitarian standard, which tolerates and approves those
> other acquired desires [like the love of money, fame, or power],
> up to the point beyond which they would be more injurious to the
> general happiness than promotive of it, enjoins and requires the
> cultivation of the love of virtue up to the greatest strength
> possible, as being above all things important to the general
> happiness.
> (Ch. 4, p. 38)

</section>
<section>

## Only Happiness ##

> It results from the preceding considerations that there is in
> reality nothing desired except happiness.  Whatever is desired
> otherwise than as a means to some end beyond itself, and
> ultimately to happiness, is desired as itself a part of
> happiness, and is not desired for itself until it has become so.
> (Ch. 4, p. 38)

<section>

## Violation of Legal Rights ##

</section>
<section>

## Unjust Laws ##

> Among these diversities of opinion it seems to be universally
> admitted that there may be unjust laws, and that law,
> consequently, is not the ultimate criterion of justice.
> (Ch. 5, p. 44)

</section>
<section>

## Desert ##

</section>
<section>

## Distributive Justice ##

> Some communists consider it unjust that the produce of the labor
> of the community should be shared on any other principle than
> that of exact equality; others think it just that those should
> receive most whose wants are greatest; while others hold that
> those who work harder, or who produce more, or whose services are
> more valuable to the community, may justly claim a larger quota
> in the division of the produce.
> (Ch. 5, pp. 46--47)

</section>
<section>

## Punishment ##

> We do not call anything wrong unless we mean to imply that a
> person ought to be punished in some way or other for doing it---
> if not by law, by the opinion of his fellow creatures; if not by
> opinion, by the reproaches of his own conscience.  This seems the
> real turning point of the distinction between morality and simple
> expediency.
> (Ch. 5, pp. 48--49)

## Two Key Elements ##

> In each case the supposition [of injustice] implies two things: a
> wrong done, and some assignable person who is wronged.
> (Ch. 5, p. 50)

## Justice versus Beneficence ##

</section>
<section>

## Animal Desire ##

> And the sentiment of justice appears to me to be the animal
> desire to repel or retaliate a hurt or damage to oneself or to
> those with whom one sympathizes, widened so as to include all
> persons.
> (Ch. 5, p. 53)

</section>
<section>

## Definition of a Right ##

> To have a right, then, is, I conceive, to have something which
> society ought to defend me in the possession of.
> (Ch. 5, p. 54)

</section>
<section>

## Security ##

> The interest involved is that of security, to everyone's feelings
> the most vital of interests.  All other earthly benefits are
> needed by one person, not needed by another; and many of them
> can, if necessary, be cheerfully foregone or replaced by
> something else; but security no human being can possibly do
> without.
> (Ch. 5, p. 54)
