# Chapter 4 #

## Free Will ##

</section>
<section>

> In general, we can say that having free will means that we can
> make choices in our lives and that these choices are up to us.

</section>
<section>

## The Past is Set in Stone ##

</section>
<section>

> The question that arises is this: How much power does the past
> have over the future?

</section>
<section>

## Determinism ##

> The theory that the future is FIXED by the past is called
> determinism.

</section>
<section>

## Kinds of Determinism ##

1. Physical Determinism (what we're going to talk about)
2. Theological Determinism
3. Alethic Determinism

## We Wouldn't Feel Different ##

## Main Positions ##

                    Free Will?      Determinism?
------------------- --------------- -----------------------
Libertarianism      Yes             No
Compatibilism       Yes             Yes
Hard Determinism    No              Yes

# Hard Determinism #

</section>
<section>

## Let's Distinguish ##

1. Determinism
2. Hard Determinism
3. Fatalism

</section>
<section>

## The Principle of Sufficient Reason ##

</section>
<section>

1. All events have causes.
2. All our actions are events.
3. All caused events are determined by the past.
4. $\therefore$ All our actions are determined by the past.
5. If all our actions are determined by the past, then we have no
   power to act other than we do indeed act.
6. If we have no power to act other than we in fact do act, then we
   have no free will.

$\therefore$ We have no free will

</section>
<section>

1. If hard determinism is true, then we have no free will.
2. If we have no free will, then we are not responsible for our
   actions.
3. We are responsible for our actions.

$\therefore$ Hard determinism is false.

# Indeterminism #

</section>
<section>

## Recent Science ##

</section>
<section>

## Control ##

</section>
<section>

1. If an action is the result of a causally indeterministic
   process, then I can have no control over that action (it is
   arbitrary whether I do it or not).
2. If I can have no control over an action, then I cannot really be
   free with respect to that action.

$\therefore$ I cannot be free with respect to an action that is the outcome of a causally indeterministic process.

</section>
<section>

## No Escape? ##

1. Either Determinism or Indeterminism
2. If determinism, then no free will
3. If indeterminism, then no free will

$\therefore$ no free will

# Compatibilism #

</section>
<section>

> A compatibilist maintains that our freedom and responsibility are
> not threatened by the fact that our actions are causaly
> determined to take place.  Our actions can still be free as long
> as they are causally determined in the right way.

</section>
<section>

> What matters is that you were able to act on your desires and
> that no constraints prevented you from doing so.

</section>
<section>

> The compatibilist responds that "could have done otherwise"
> should be understood hypothetically; to say that I could have
> eaten sushi simply means that if I had had the desire to eat
> sushi, I could have acted on that desire.  As a matter of fact, I
> did *not* have a desire to eat sushi, but hypothetically I could
> have acted on that desire *if* it had been present.

</section>
<section>

## Traditional Compatibilist Criteria ##

1. The action is caused by the will of the agent
2. The action is performed without constraints

> What have you truly loved up to now, what has elevated your soul,
> what has mastered it and at the same time delighted it?  Place
> these venerated objects before you in a row, and perhaps they

## Consequence Argument ##

1. No one has power over the past and the laws of nature.
2. Our future actions are necessary consequences of the past and
   the laws of nature.
3. If we have no power over $X$, then we also have no power over
   the future necessary consequences of $X$.
4. $\therefore$ we have no power over our future actions.
5. In order to be responsible for our future actions, we must have
   power over our future actions.

$\therefore$ We are not resonsible for our future actions [on the assumption that determinism is true, premise (2) above].
