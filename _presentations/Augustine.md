# Confessions I #

</section>
<section>

> You stir man to take pleasure in praising you, because you have
> made us for yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in
> you.
> (1.1.1)

</section>
<section>

> Most high, utterly good, utterly powerful, most omnipotent, most
> merciful and most just, deeply hidden yet most intimately
> present, perfection of both beauty and strength, stable and
> incomprehensible, immutable and yet changing all things, never
> new, never old, making everything new.
> (1.4.4)

</section>
<section>

## Divine Simplicity ##

> In you it is not one thing to be and another to live: the supreme
> degree of being and the supreme degree of life are one and the
> same thing.
> (1.6.10)

</section>
<section>

## Original Sin ##

</section>
<section>

> And so it is that the punishment of every disordered mind is its
> own disorder.
> (1.12.19)

</section>
<section>

> Any breach of the rules I would not tolerate and, if I detected
> it, would fiercely denounce it, though it was exactly what I was
> doing to others.  And if I was caught and denounced, I used to
> prefer to let my rage have free rein rather than to give ground.
> (1.19.30)

</section>
<section>

> But every one of these qualities are gifts of my God: I did not
> give them to myself.  They are good qualities, and their totality
> is my self.  Therefore he who made me is good, and he is my good.
> (1.20.31)

# Confessions III #

<section>

## Love ##

</section>
<section>

## Cicero ##

</section>
<section>

> We have more reliable knowledge in our images of bodies which
> really exist, and the bodies are more certain than the images.
> But you are no body.  Nor are you soul, which is the life of
> bodies; for the life of bodies is superior to bodies themselves,
> and a more certain object of knowledge.  But you are the life of
> souls, the life of lives.  You live in dependence only on
> yourself, and you never change, life of my soul.
> (3.6.10)

</section>
<section>

## Manichaeism ##

</section>
<section>

## Interior Intimo Meo ##

> But you were more inward than my most inward part and higher than
> the highest within me.
> (3.6.11)

# Confessions VII #

</section>
<section>

## Trouble Imagining Something Nonphysical ##

</section>
<section>

## Ethical Dualism ##

</section>
<section>

## Unde Hoc Malum ##

> Yet I had no clear and explicit grasp of the cause of evil.
> (7.3.4)

</section>
<section>

## Free Will ##

> I was brought up into your light by the fact that I knew myself
> both to have a will and to be alive.  Therefore when I willed or
> did not will something, I was utterly certain that none other
> than myself was willing or not willing.
> (7.3.5)

</section>
<section>

## The Deeper Problem ##

> Who made me?  Is not my God not only good but the supreme Good?
> Why then have I the power to will evil and to reject good?
> (7.3.5)

</section>
<section>

## Matter? ##

</section>
<section>

## Neoplatonism ##

> By the Platonic books I was admonished to return into myself.
> With you as my guide I entered into my innermost citadel, and was
> given power to do so because you had become my helper. I entered
> in with my soul's eye, such as it was, saw above that same eye of
> my soul the immutable light higher than my mind.
> (7.10.16)

</section>
<section>

> And I considered the other things below you, and I saw that
> neither can they be said absolutely to be or aboslutely not to
> be.  They are because they come from you.  But they are not
> because they are not what you are.  That which truly is is that
> which unchangeably abides
> (7.11.17)

# Confessions VIII #

</section>
<section>

## Passions and Habit ##

> The consequence of a distorted will is passion.  By servitude to
> passion, habit is formed, and habit to which there is no
> resistence becomes necessity.
> (8.5.10)

</section>
<section>

## Conflict of Wills ##

> The new will, which was beginning to be within me a will to serve
> you freely and to enjoy you, God, the only sure source of
> pleasure, was not yet strong enough to conquer my older will,
> which had the strength of old habit.  So my two wills, one old,
> the other new, one carnal, the other spiritual, were in conflict
> with one another.
> (8.5.10)

</section>
<section>

## St. Antony ##

</section>
<section>

> The one necessary condition, which meant not only going but at
> once arriving there, was to have the will to go---provided only
> that the will was strong and unqualified, not the turning and
> twisting first this way, then that, of a will half-wounded,
> struggling with one part rising up and the other part falling
> down.
> (8.8.20)

</section>
<section>

## Full Responsibility ##

</section>
<section>

## Divided Self ##

> The self which willed to serve was identical with the self which
> was unwilling.  It was I.  I was neither wholly willing nor
> wholly unwilling.  So I was in conflict with myself and was
> dissociated from myself.  The dissociation came about against my
> will.  Yet this was not a manifestation of the nature of an alien
> mind but the punishment suffered in my own mind.
> (8.10.22)

</section>
<section>

## Lady Continence ##

> Do you think them capable of achieving [self-control] by their
> own resources and not by the Lord their God?  Their Lord God gave
> me to them.  Why are you relying on yourself, only to find
> yourself unreliable?  Cast yourself upon him, do not be afraid.
> He will not withdraw himself so that you fall.  Make the leap
> without anxiety; he will catch you and heal you.
> (8.11.27)
