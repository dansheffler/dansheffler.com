## Problem of Evil Example ##

- Deductive or "Logical" Problem of Evil
- Inductive or "Evidential" Problem of Evil

The quote in the book is too long to go over in class.  Have the students pull out page 15 and read it.

# Logical Consistency #

</section>

<section data-background="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/William_James_b1842c.jpg">

> [Philosophy is] an unusually stubborn effort to think clearly

---William James

</section>
<section>

> In general we can say that a set of claims is **logically
> consistent** if and only if it is possible that all claims in the
> set are true at the same time; a set of claims is **logically
> inconsistent** if and only if it is impossible that all claims in
> the set are true at the same time.

</section>
<section>

## Background Beliefs ##

<aside class=notes>
Rauhut uses a nice example about the possible tension between the belief that only physical entities exist and the belief that angels exist.  It depends on whether one also believes that angels are physical.

## Contradictions ##

> a sentence that both denies and asserts that something is the case.

</section>
<section>

## Modifying the Big Picture ##

<aside class=notes>
The example of Maria on page 18.  Perhaps discuss the various ways that Maria could adjust her overall picture of the world to make things consistent.

## Causal vs. Logical Possibility ##

## Can You Imagine It? ##

> A state of affairs is logically possible if it does not entail a
> contradiction.

<aside class=notes>
Perhaps go through the list of examples to see whether students understand the definition.

<section>

# Arguments #

</section>
<section>

> In philosophy we understand arguments to be reasons for thinking
> that an assertion is true.

</section>
<section>

> Every argument has two components: a claim that the argument
> tries to establish and reasons that are offered in support of
> that claim.  The claim is called the **conclusion** of the
> argument, and the reasons offered in support are called
> **premises**.

<aside class="notes">

Perhaps have the students go through the food for thought on page 25 and practice offering premises in support of the given conclusions.

</section>
<section>

## Standard Form ##

<aside class="notes">

Perhaps have the students do a few of the exercises on page 26 and 27, translating arguments into standard form.

# Deductive Arguments #

## Validity ##
