## The Good ##

> Every craft and every line of inquiry, and likewise every action
> and decision, seems to seek some good; that is why some people
> were right to describe the good as what everything seeks.
> (1094a)

</section>
<section>

## The Ultimate Good ##

</section>
<section>

## What is the Good? ##

> As far as its name goes, most people virtually agree; for both
> the many and the cultivated call it happiness, and they suppose
> that living well and doing well are the same as being happy.  But
> they disagree about what happiness is, and the many do not give
> the same answer as the wise. (1095a)

</section>
<section>

## The Vulgar Option ##

> The many, the most vulgar, would seem to conceive the good and
> happiness as pleasure, and hence they also like the life of
> gratification.  In this they appear completely slavish, since the
> life they decide on is a life for grazing animals.
> (1095b)

</section>
<section>

## Complete without Qualification ##

> Now happiness, more than anything else, seems complete without
> qualification.  For we always choose it because of itself, never
> because of something else.
> (1097a--b)

</section>
<section>

## Self-Sufficient ##

> We regard something as self-sufficient when all by itself it
> makes a life choiceworthy and lacking nothing; and that is what
> we think happiness does.
> (1097b)

</section>
<section>

## Function and Excellence ##

> And so the human good proves to be activity of the soul in accord
> with virtue, and indeed with the best and most complete virtue,
> if there are more virtues than one.
> (1098a)

## Character and Habit ##

> We become just by doing just actions, temperate by doing
> temparate actions, brave by doing brave actions.
> (1103a--b)

</section>

## Excess and Deficiency ##

</section>
<section>

## Definition of Virtue ##

> Every virtue causes its possessors to be in a good state and to
> perform their functions well.  The virtue of eyes, for instance,
> makes the eyes and their functioning excellent, because it makes
> us see well.
> (1106a)

</section>
<section>

## The Intermediate ##

> This, indeed, is why people regularly comment on well-made
> products that nothing could be added or subtracted; they assume
> that excess or deficiency ruins a good result, whereas the mean
> preserves it.
> (1106b)

</section>
<section>

## The Difficulty of Virtue ##

> There are many ways to be in error...but there is only one way to
> be correct.  That is why error is easy and correctness is
> difficult, since it is easy to miss the target and difficult to
> hit it.
> (1106b)

## Know Your Own Tendencies ##

> We must also examine what we ourselves drift into easily.  For
> different people have different natural tendencies toward
> different goals, and we shall come to know our own tendencies
> from the pleasure or pain that arises in us.  We must drag
> ourselves off in the contrary direction; for if we pull far away
> from error, as they do in straightening bent wood, we shall reach
> the intermediate condition.

## Involuntary versus Voluntary ##

> Since involuntary action is either forced or caused by ignorance,
> voluntary action seems to be what has its principle in the agent
> himself, knowing the particulars that constitute the action.
> (1111a)

</section>
<section>

## Decision, Deliberation, and Wish ##

- Wish concerns ends.
- Deliberation concerns the way to achieve these ends.
- Decision happens when we have deliberated long enough that we
  clearly see an action that we can immediately take.

</section>
<section>

## Principle of Alternate Possibilities ##

> Hence virtue is also up to us, and so also, in the same way, is
> vice.  For when acting is up to us, so is not acting, and when no
> is up to us, so is yes.
> (113b)

</section>
<section>

## Being the Cause of Our Own Ignorance ##

> A drunk, for instance, pays a double penalty; for the principle
> is in him, since he controls whether he gets drunk, and his
> getting drunk causes his ignorance.
> (1113b) ...
> Likewise for any other ignorance that seems to be caused by the
> agent's inattention; [the law-makers] assume it is up to him not
> to be ignorant, since he controls whether he pays attention.
> (1114a)

</section>
<section>

## The Kind of Person Who is Inattentive ##

> But presumably he is the sort of person who is inattentive.
> Still, he is himself responsible for becoming this sort of
> person, because he has lived carelessly.  Similarly, an
> individual is responsible for being unjust, because he has
> cheated, and for being intemperate, because he has passed his
> time in drinking and the like; for each type of activity produces
> the corresponding sort of person.
> (1114a)

</section>
<section>

## Stone Example ##

> Just as it was up to someone to throw a stone, since the
> principle was up to him, though he can no longer take it back
> once he has thrown it.  Similarly, then, the person who is now
> unjust or intemperate was originally free not to acquire this
> character, so that he has it willingly, though once he has
> acquired the character, he is no longer free not to have it now.
> (1114a)

## The Motivation of Bravery ##

> The brave person, however, must be moved by the fine, not by
> compulsion.
> (1116b)

</section>
<section>

## Definition of Bravery ##

> The brave person, on the contrary, stands firm against what is
> and appears frightening to a human being; he does this because it
> is fine to stand firm and shameful to fail.
> (1117a)

</section>
<section>

## Brave People are Not Unafraid ##

> The brave person will find death and wounds painful, and suffer
> them unwillingly, but he will endure them because that is fine or
> because failure is shameful.  Indeed, the truer it is that he has
> every virtue and the happier he is, the more pain he will feel at
> the prospect of death.  For this person, more than anyone, finds
> it worthwhile to be alive, and knows he is being deprived of the
> greatest goods, and this is painful.  But he is no less brave for
> all that; presumably, indeed, he is all the braver, because he
> chooses what is fine in war at the cost of all these goods.
> (1117b)

</section>
<section>

## Licentiousness and Touch ##

> Rather, [licentious people] enjoy the gratification that comes
> entirely through touch, in eating and drinking and in what are
> called the pleasures of sex.
> (1118a)

</section>
<section>

## Virtuous Restraint ##

> And someone is temperate because he does not feel pain at the
> absence of what is pleasant, or at refraining from it.
> (1119a)

## The Seriousness of Wealth ##

> Ungenerosity is always ascribed to those who take wealth more
> seriously than is right.
> (1119b)

</section>
<section>

## More Blessed to Give ##

> For it is more proper to virtue to do good than to receive good,
> and more proper to do fine actions than not to do shameful ones.
> (1120a)

</section>
<section>

## Showing Off ##

> The excess is called vulgarity, poor taste, and such things.
> These are excesses not because they spend an excessively great
> amount on the right things, but because they show off in the
> wrong circumstances and in the wrong way.
> (1122a)

</section>
<section>

## Make it Worth It ##

> [The magnificent person] spends more readily on long-lasting
> results, since these are the finest.  In each case he spends on
> what is fitting.
> (1123a)

## Definition of Magnanimity ##

> The magnanimous person, then, seems to be the one who thinks
> himself worthy of great things and is really worthy of them.
> (1123b)

</section>
<section>

## Self-Defeat ##

> SOmeone who thinks he is worthy of less than he is worthy of is
> pusillanimous, whether he is worthy of great or of moderate
> things, or of little and thinks himself worthy of still less.
> (1123b)

</section>
<section>

## Thinking Less of Others ##

> For the magnanimous person is justified when he thinks less of
> others, since his beliefs are true; but the many think less of
> others with no good reason.
> (1124b)
