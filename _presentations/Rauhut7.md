# Argument from Religious Experience #

</section>
<section>

## Induction to Best Explanation ##

</section>
<section data-background="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/exsmSlxnbHQ/maxresdefault.jpg">

## Principle of Credulity ##

> If a person has experiences that seem to be of $X$, then the
> person has reason to believe that $X$ exists unless the person
> has further reason to indicate that the experiences should not be
> trusted [i.e. a "defeater"].

## Fails to be Intersubjective ##

> [Religious experiences] have the right to be absolutely
> authoritative over the individual to whom they come...[but] no
> authority emanates from them which should make it a duty for
> those who stand outside of them to accept their revelations.

# The Cosmological Argument #

<section>

## Principle of Sufficient Reason ##

</section>
<section>

## Necessary versus Contingent Beings ##

</section>
<section>

## Inductive Form of the Argument ##

1. The world, or cosmos, exists.
2. There must be an explanation of why the world exists (because it is a contingent being).
3. The best explanation of why the world exists is that the world was created by a necessary being.
4. $\therefore$ A necessary being probably exists.

# The Ontological Argument #

</section>
<section>

1. God $=_df$ that than which nothing greater can be conceived.
2. To exist is greater than not to exist.
3. Suppose (for *reductio*) that God does not exist
    4. God_2_ $=_df$ God + actually existing.
    5. God_2_ > God (from 2, 3, and 4)
    6. $\neg$(God_2_ > God) (from 1, 3, and 4)
7. $\therefore$ God does exist (because 5 and 6 are a contradiction
   that follows from 3).

## JL Mackie's Version ##

1. God is all good (=he would prevent any evil that he can).
2. God is all powerful (=there are no limits to what he can do).
3. God is all knowing (=God knows about everything).
4. Evil exits.

Mackie asserts: We must reject one of these since it is irrational to believe all four to be true at the same time.

## Ivan Karamazov ##

<section>

1. It is very likely that instances of pointless suffering exist.
2. If God exists, then all suffering has a point.
3. $\therefore$ God probably does not exist.
