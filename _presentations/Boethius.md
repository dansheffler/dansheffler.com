## Vision of Lady Philosophy ##

<section>

## Amnesia of the Self ##

> It is nothing serious, only a touch of amnesia that he is
> suffering, the common disease of deluded minds.  He has forgotten
> for a while who he is, but he will soon remember once he has
> recognized me.  To make it easier for him I will wipe a little of
> the blinding cloud of worldly concern from his eyes.
> (1.2)

## Hope and Fear ##

> If first you rid yourself of hope and fear\
> You have disarmed the tyrant's wrath:\
> But whosoever quakes in fear or hope,\
> Drifting and losing mastery,\
> Has cast away his shield, has left his place,\
> And binds the chain with which he will be bound.\
> (1.4)

## The True Exile ##

> It is not simply a case of your having been banished from your
> home; you have wandered away yourself, or if you prefer to be
> thought of as having been banished, it is you yourself that have
> been the instrument of it.
> (1.5)

</section>
<section>

## The True Kingdom ##

> You seem to have forgotten the oldest law of your community, that
> any man who has chosen to make his dwelling there has the sacred
> right never to be banished.  So there can be no fear of exile for
> any man within its walls and moat.  On the other hand, if anyone
> stops wanting to live there, he automatically stops deserving it.
> (1.5)

## Changing Fortune ##

> But you are wrong if you think Fortune has changed towards you.
> Change is her normal behaviour, her true nature.  In the very act
> of changing she has preserved her own particular kind of
> constancy towards you.  She was exactly the same when she was
> flattering you and luring you on with enticements of a false kind
> of happiness.  You have discovered the changing faces of the
> random goddess.
> (2.1)

</section>
<section>

## The Most Wretched Grief ##

> In all adversity of fortune, the most wretched kind is once to
> have been happy.

</section>
<section>

## What Fortune Can't Take Away ##

> Why then do you mortal men seek after happiness outside
> yourselves, when it lies within you?  You are led astray by error
> and ignorance.  I will briefly show you what complete happiness
> hinges upon.  If I ask you whether there is anything more
> precious to you than your own self, you will say no.  So if you
> are in possession of yourself you will possess something you
> would never wish to lose and something Fortune could never take
> away.
> (2.4)

</section>
<section>

## Seeking What Isn't Ours ##

> It seems as if you feel a lack of any blessing of your own inside
> you, which is driving you to seek your blessing in things
> separate and external.  And so when a being endowed with a
> godlike quality in virtue of his rational nature thinks that his
> only splendour lies in the possession of inanimate goods, it is
> the overthrow of the natural order.  Other creatures are content
> with what is their own, but you, whose mind is made in the image
> of God, seek to adorn your superior nature with inferior objects,
> oblivious of the great wrong you do your Creator.
> (2.5)

</section>
<section>

## The Condition of Man ##

> Indeed, the condition of human nature is just this; man towers
> above the rest of creation so long as he recognizes his own
> nature, and when he forgets it, he sinks lower than the beasts.
> (2.5)

## What Humans Seek ##

</section>
<section>

## Inborn Longing ##

> You earthly creatures, you also dream of your origin, however
> faint the vision.  You do have some sort of notion, unclear as it
> is, of the true goal of happiness, and so an instinctive sense of
> direction actually guides you toward the true good, only various
> errors lead you astray.
> (3.3)

</section>
<section>

## Creation ##

> O Thou who dost by everlasting reason rule,\
> Creator of the planets and the sky, who time\
> From timelessness dost bring, unchanging Mover,\
> No cause drove Thee to mould unstable matter, but\
> The form benign of highest good within Thee set.\
> All things Thou bringest forth from Thy high archetype:\
> Thou, height of beauty, in Thy mind the beauteous world\
> Dost bear, and in that ideal likeness shaping it,\
> Dost order perfect parts a perfect whole to frame.\
> (3.9)

</section>
<section>

## God and Perfection ##

> Reason shows that God is so good that we are convinced that His
> goodness is perfect.  Otherwise He couldn't be the author of
> creation.  There would have to be something else possessing
> perfect goodness over and above God, which would seem to be
> superior to Him and of greater antiquity.  For all perfect things
> are obviously superior to those that are imperfect.  Therefore,
> to avoid an unending argument, it must be admitted that the
> supreme God is to the highest degree filled with supreme and
> perfect goodness.  But we have agreed that perfect good is true
> happiness; so that it follows that true happiness is to be found
> in the supreme God.
> (3.10)

</section>
<section>

## Happiness and Divinity ##

> Since it is through the possession of happiness that people
> become happy, and since happiness is in fact divinity, it is
> clear that it is through the possession of divinity that they
> become happy.  But by the same logic as men become just through
> the possession of justice, or wise through the possession of
> wisdom, so those who possess divinity necessarily become divine.
> Each happy individual is therefore divine.  While only God is so
> by nature, as many as you like may become so by participation.
> (3.10)

## The Weakness of Wickedness ##

> Think of the extent of the weakness impeding the wicked.  It is
> not as if the prizes they failed to win were mere sports
> trophies.  The quest in which they fail is the quest for the
> highest and most important of all things, and success is denied
> these wretched men in the very pursuit they toil at night and day
> to the exclusion of all else, the same pursuit in which the
> strength of the good stands out.
> (4.2)

</section>
<section>

## Becoming Gods ##

> The reward of the good, then, a reward that can never be
> decreased, that no one's power can diminish, and no one's
> wickedness darken, is to become gods.
> (4.3)

</section>
<section>

## Goodness is its Own Reward ##

> Therefore, just as goodness is its own reward, so the punishment
> of the wicked is their very wickedness.
> (4.3)

</section>
<section>

## Failing to be Human ##

> This means that anything which turns away from goodness ceases to
> exist, and thus that the wicked cease to be what they once were.
> That they used to be human is shown by the human appearance of
> their body which still remains.  So it was by falling into
> wickedness that they also lost their human nature.  Now, since
> only goodness can raise a man above the level of human kind, it
> follows that it is proper that wickedness thrusts down to a level
> below mankind those whom it has dethroned from the condition of
> being human.
> (4.3)

</section>
<section>

## Orientation of the Mind ##

> But let us see what is decreed by everlasting law; if you have
> turned your mind to higher things, there is no need of a judge to
> award a prize; it is you yourself who have brought yourself to a
> more excellent state: but if you have directed your zeal towards
> lower things, do not look for punishment from without; it is you
> yourself who have plunged yourself into the worse condition.
> (4.4)

</section>
<section>

## Pity for the Wicked ##

> This is why among wise men there is no place at all left for
> hatred.  For no one except the greatest of fools would hate good
> men.  And there is no reason at all for hating the bad.  For just
> as weakness is a disease of the body, so wickedness is a disease
> of the mind.  And if this is so, since we think of people who are
> sick in body as deserving sympathy rather than hatred, much more
> so do they deserve pity rather than blame who suffer an evil more
> sever than any physical illness.
> (4.4)

## Chance ##

> If chance is defined as an event produced by random motion
> without any causal nexus, I would say that there is no such thing
> as chance...[but] whenever something is done for some purpose,
> and for certain reasons something other than what was intended
> happens, it is called chance.
> (5.1)

</section>
<section>

## Free Will ##

> "There is freedom," she said.  "For it would be impossible for
> any rational nature to exist without it.  Whatever by nature has
> the use of reason has the power of judgement to decide each
> matter.  It can distinguish by itself between what to avoid and
> what to desire.
> (5.2)

</section>
<section>

## Objection from Foreknowledge ##

> Well, the two seem clean contrary and opposite, God's universal
> foreknowledge and freedom of the will.  If God foresees all
> things and cannot be mistaken in any way, what Providence has
> foreseen as a future event must happen.  So that if from eternity
> Providence foreknows not only men's actions but also their
> thoughts and desires, there will be no freedom of will.  No
> action or desire will be able to exist other than that which
> God's infallible Providence has foreseen.
> (5.3)

</section>
<section>

## God the Author of Evil? ##

> Nothing more wicked can be conceived than this, for as the whole
> order of things is derived from Providence and there is no room
> for human thoughts, it follows that our wickedness, too, is
> derived from the Author of all good.
> (5.3)

</section>
<section>

## Definition of Eternity ##

> Eternity, then, is the complete, simultaneous and perfect
> possession of everlasting life (Aeternitas igitur est
> interminabilis vitae tota simul et perfecta possessio).
> (5.6)

</section>
<section>

## Eternal Present ##

> So that which embraces and possesses simultaneously the whole
> fullness of everlasting life, which lacks nothing of the future
> and has lost nothing of the past, that is what may properly be
> said to be eternal.  Of necessity it will always be present to
> itself, controlling itself, ans having present the infinity of
> fleeting time.
> (5.6)

</section>
<section>

## Time as Imitation of Eternity ##

> The infinite changing of things in time is an attempt to imitate
> this state of the presence of unchanging life, but since it
> cannot portray or equal that state in falls from sameness into
> change, from the immediacy of presence into the infinite extent
> of past and future.
> (5.6)
