> He says that the first principle is neither water nor any other

> of which they come to be, according to necessity, for they pay

## Physikoi ##

(φύσικοι)

<aside class="notes">

Emphasize that the take away from all these guys is that they were asking questions about the sum totality of everything and that they gave characteristically *reductive* answers.

Discussion question: Do you think that we can reduce the sum totality of *everything* down to one basic kind of thing?  What about just a few?  Do you think that there is anything that this kind of explanation leaves out?

## Numbers ##

<aside class="notes">

Ask about the connection between the universe and numbers.  Why do you think it is that many things in the universe turn out to be very mathematical?  Example Newton's law of gravitation.

> Since [the Pythagoreans] saw the attributes and ratios of musical

> likeness of numbers in their entire nature, and numbers seemed to
> be primary in all nature, they supposed the elements of numbers
> to be the elements of all things that are.

---Aristotle, *Metaphysics* 1.5 985b23--986a2

<aside class="notes">

Notice how this is a very different *kind* of first principle from the *physikoi* above.

Ask whether they agree with this or not.  Use the discussion to draw out the notion of reductive explanation.
