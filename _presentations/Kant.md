# Preface #

## Is and Ought ##

> The laws of [nature] are those according to which everything does
> happen, while the laws of the [ethics] are those according to which
> everything ought to happen.
> (388)

</section>
<section>

## A Priori versus A Posteriori ##

</section>
<section>

## Grounded on Pure Reason ##

> The ground of obligation here must therefore be sought not in the
> nature of man nor in the circumstances of the world in which man
> is placed, but must be sough a priori solely in the concepts of
> pure reason.
> (389)

</section>
<section>

## Supreme Principle of Morality ##

> The present *Grounding* is, however, intended for nothing more
> than seeking our and establishing the supreme principle of
> morality.
> (392)

<section>

## Good without Qualification ##

> There is no possibility at all in the world, or even out of it,
> which can be regarded as good without qualification, except a
> *good will*.
> (393)

</section>
<section>

## Worthy of Happiness ##

> Thus a good will seems to constitute the indispensable condition
> of being even worthy of happiness.
> (393)

</section>
<section>

## Reason, Instinct, and Nature ##

</section>
<section>

## Practical Reason ##

> But inasmuch as reason has been imparted to us as a practical
> faculty, i.e., as one which is to have influence on the will, its
> true function must be to produce a will which is not merely good
> as a means to some further end, but is good in itself.
> (396)

</section>
<section>

## "In Accordance With" versus "From" Duty ##

</section>
<section>

## Businessman Example ##

</section>
<section>

## Where is the Worth? ##

> An action done from duty has its moral worth, not in the purpose
> that is to be attained by it, but in the maxim according to which
> the action is determined.
> (399)

</section>
<section>

## The Categorical Imperative ##

> I should never act except in such a way that I can also will that
> my maxim should become a universal law.
> (402)

</section>
<section>

## Promises Example ##

</section>
<section>

## Counterweight ##

> Man feels within himself a powerful counterweight to all the
> commands of duty, which are presented to him by reason as being
> so pre-eminently worthy of respect; this counterweight consists
> of his needs and inclinations, whose total satisfaction is summed
> up under the name of happiness.
> (405)

<section>

## Experience ##

> The question at issue here is not whether this or that has
> happened but that reason of itself and independently of all
> experience commands what ought to happen.
> (408)

</section>
<section>

## Examples ##

> Every example of morality presented to me must itself first be
> judged according to principles of morality in order to see
> whether it is fit to serve as an original example.
> (408)

</section>
<section>

## What is an Imperative? ##

> The representation of an objective principle insofar as it
> necessitates the will is called a command (of reason), and the
> formula of the command is called an imperative.
> (413)

</section>
<section>

## The Categorical Imperative ##

> The categorical imperative would be one which represented an
> action as objectively necessary in itself, without reference to
> another end.
> (414)

</section>
<section>

## Happiness ##

> And thus the imperative that refers to the choice of means to
> one's own happiness, i.e., the precept of prudence, still remains
> hypothetical; the action is commanded not absolutely but only as
> a means to a further purpose.
> (416)

(Contrast this with Mill)

<section>

## First Formulation ##

> Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time
> will that it should become a universal law.
> (421)

## Borrowing Money Example ##

(Perfect duty toward others)

## Natural Talents Example ##

## Charitable Giving Example ##

<section>

## I'm an Exception ##

> [When we make an immoral decision] we would find a contradiction
> in our own will, viz., that a certain principle be objectively
> necessary as a universal law and yet subjectively not hold
> universally but should admit of exceptions.
> (424)

</section>
<section>

## We are Ends ##

> Now I say that man, and in general every rational being, exists
> as an end in himself and not merely as a means to be arbitrarily
> used by this or that will.  He must in all his actions, whether
> directed to himself or to other rational beings, always by
> regarded at the same time as an end.
> (428)

</section>
<section>

## Second Formulation ##

> Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own
> person or in the person of another, always at the same time as an
> end and never simply as a means.
> (429)

</section>
<section>

## Autonomy versus Heteronomy ##

</section>
<section>

## Kingdom of Ends ##

> A rational being belongs to the kingdom of ends as a member when
> he legislates in it universal laws while also being himself
> subject to these laws.  He belongs to it as sovereign, when as
> legislator he is himself subject to the will of no other.
> (433)

## Price versus Dignity ##

> Whatever has reference to general human inclinations and needs
> has a market price...but that which constitutes the condition
> under which alone something can be an end in itself has not
> merely a relative worth, i.e. a price, but has an intrinsic
> worth, i.e. dignity.
> (434--435)

</section>
<section>

## Autonomy is the Ground of Dignity ##

> Hence autonomy is the ground of the dignity of human nature and
> of every rational nature.
> (436)

</section>
<section>

## Freedom ##

> The will is a kind of causality belonging to living beings
> insofar as they are rational; freedom would be the property of
> this causality that makes it effective independent of any
> determination by alien causes.
> (446)

</section>
<section>

## Morality is Freedom ##

> Thus a free will and a will subject to moral laws are one and the
> same.
> (447)

</section>
<section>

## The Sensible World versus the Intelligible World ##

</section>
<section>

## Ought to have Been Done ##

> All men think of themselves as free as far as their will is
> concerned.  Hence arise all judgments upon actions as being such
> as ought to have been done, even though they were not done.
> (455)

</section>
<section>

## The True Self ##

> Since he is in such a world [i.e. the intelligible world] his
> proper self only as intelligence (whereas regarded as a human
> being he is merely an appearance of himself), those laws [i.e. of
> the intelligible world] apply to him immediately and
> categorically.
> (457)
