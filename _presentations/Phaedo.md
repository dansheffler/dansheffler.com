## Definition of Death ##

> Is [death] anything else than the separation of the soul from the
> body?  Do we believe that death is this, namely, that the body
> comes to be separated by itself apart from the soul, and the soul
> comes to be separate by itself apart from the body?
> (64c)

- Do we say that there is such a thing as the Just itself, or not?
- We do say so, by Zeus.
- And the Beautiful and the Good?
- Of course
- And have you ever seen any of these things with your eyes? (65d)

# The Recollection Argument #

</section>
<section>

1.  There is such a thing as the Equal itself (74a).
2.  We get the Equal itself in mind by seeing equal sticks and
    stones, which couldn't be the Equal itself (74b--c).
3.  Therefore, "We must possess knowledge of the Equal before that
    time when we first saw the equal objects and realized that all
    these objects strive to be like the Equal but are deficient in
    this" (74e--75a).
4.  This kind of experience is inherent to sense perception, so we
    must have gained knowledge of the Equal itself before we ever
    began to have sense perception of equal objects at birth (75b).

> One day I heard someone reading, as he said, from a book of
> Anaxagoras, and saying that it is Mind that directs and is the
> cause of everything.  I was delighted with this cause, and it
> seemed to me good, in a way, that Mind should be the cause of
> all.  I thought that if this were so, the directing Mind would
> direct everything and arrange each thing in the way that was
> best.

## Failure of Mechanical Causes ##

<aside class=notes>
Use the passage from 98d--99b about the why Socrates is sitting.  Make sure we distinguish "that without which" from true causes.

## Success? ##

<aside class=notes>
Ask whether they think Socrates has succeeded in comforting his companions.  Has he succeeded in proving the immortality of the soul?  Has he succeeded in preparing for death by leading a life of philosophy?
