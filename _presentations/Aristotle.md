## "Said of a Subject" ##

</section>
<section>

## "In a Subject" ##

> I call "in a subject" what is in something, not as a part, and
> cannot exist separately from what it is in.
> (1a)

</section>
<section>

> Some are neither in a subject nor said of a subject, for example
> the individual man or the individual horse.
> (1b)

## Substance ##

(οὐσία)

What is most fundamental?

## Primary vs. Secondary Substance ##

<section>

## Substance vs. Quality ##

</section>
<section>

> Said by itself, each of the things mentioned above is no
> assertion, but, in combination with others of these, it becomes
> an assertion.  For it seems that every assertion is either true
> or false;
> (9b--10a)

</section>
<section>

## Definition ##

</section>
<section>

> It is because they are subjects for everything else that primary
> substances are most properly called substances.
> (3a)

</section>
<section>

> Each substance seems to signify a particular THIS.  As far as
> primary substances are concerned, it is indisputably true that
> each signifies a particular THIS, for what is indicated is
> individual and one in number.
> (10a)

</section>
<section>

> As far as secondary substances are concerned, it seems from the
> appearance of the name when one says "man" or "animal" that they,
> too, signify a particular THIS.  But it is not really so.
> Rather, each signifies a particular SORT.
> (10a)

# Metaphysics XII #

<section>

## Prime Mover ##

> And since whatever both is moved and initiates motion is an
> intermediary, there is something that initiated motion without
> being moved, something that is everlasting and a substance and
> actuality.
> (1072a)

</section>
<section>

## Pure Actuality ##

> But since there is something that initiates motion without itself
> being moved, and this is actually operating, it cannot be
> otherwise in any respect at all.
> (1072b)

</section>
<section>

## Pure Understanding ##

> Understanding in its own right is of what is best in its own
> right, and the highest degree of understanding is of what is best
> to the highest degree in its own right.  And understanding
> understands itself by sharing the character of the object of
> understanding.
> (1072b)

</section>
<section>

## Pure Life ##

> Further, life belongs to the god.  For the actuality of
> understanding is life, and the god is that actuality.
> (1072b)

</section>
<section>

## Narcissistic? ##

> [The divine understanding], then, must understand itself, so that
> its understanding is an understanding of understanding.
> (1074b)

<section>

## The Good ##

> Every craft and every investigation, and likewise every action
> and decision, seems to aim at some good; hence the good has been
> well described as that at which everything aims.
> (1094a)

</section>
<section>

## What is the Good? ##

> As far as its name goes, most people virtually agree [about what
> the good is], since both the many and the cultivated call it
> happiness, and suppose that living well and doing well are the
> same as being happy.  But they disagree about what happiness is,
> and the many do not give the same answer as the wise.
> (1095a)

## The Function of a Human Being ##

> Therefore the human good turns out to be the soul's activity that
> expresses virtue.
> (1098a)
