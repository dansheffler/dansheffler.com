# Prologue--§17 #

</section>
<section>

## Universal Object of Desire ##

> Given that all desire only what they think is good, anyone can
> easily avail himself of the following opportunity: he can at any
> time turn the mind's eye to look for the source of the things
> that are good---things that one would not want unless one judged
> them to be good.
> (§1)

</section>
<section>

## Fundamental Asymmetry ##

> Because, then, it is that through which every good thing is good,
> it is good through itself.  It therefore follows that all the
> other good things are good through something other than what they
> themselves are, while this thing alone is good through itself.
> (§1)

</section>
<section>

## Anselm's Version of the Cosmological Argument ##

</section>
<section>

## Degrees of Being ##

> Therefore, that which exists through itself, exists most of all.
> (§3)

</section>
<section>

## Brightness Analogy ##

</section>
<section>

## Ex Nihilo ##

> What I'm after is this: this thing that I call the matter of the
> concrete universe, where does this come from?  If it comes from
> some other matter, then this other matter is more truly the
> matter of the corporeal universe.
> (§7)

</section>
<section>

## Nothingness ##

</section>
<section>


## Rationality of Creation ##

> For a maker makes something rationally if, and only if, there is
> already something there in his reasoning---as a sort of exemplar.
> (Or perhaps terms like 'form', 'likeness' or 'rule' are more
> appropriate.)  The following then is clear: before all things
> existed, the manner, features and facts of their future existence
> already existed, in the reasoning of the supreme nature.
> (§9)

</section>
<section>

> And just so, nothing flourishes but through this sustaining presence.
> (§13)

</section>
<section>

## Perfection Theology ##

> The supreme nature necessarily is any $P$ that is better without
> qualification than not-$P$.  This is because the substance of the
> supreme nature alone is better than everything else.  It is that
> than which absolutely nothing is better.
> (§15)

</section>
<section>

> The necessary conclusion is then: the supreme essence is alive,
> wise, powerful, all-powerful, true, just, happy, eternal...and
> whatever is likewise better without qualification than not-
> whatever.  What the supreme nature, then, is and what it is not
> (of all the things that it might be) is now evident.  Have I not
> got to the bottom of the 'what is it?' question?
> (§15)

## Without Beginning or End ##

## Everywhere and Always ##

</section>
<section>

## Outside of Space and Time ##

> For it would seem that only things that are limited to the time
> and place they are in are bound by the law of time and place.
> (§22)

</section>
<section>

## We Hardly Exist ##

> It is the only thing that would seem, on careful examination, to
> exist without qualification, perfectly and absolutely, while all
> other things almost do not, and hardly do, exist.

# §44--§80 #

</section>
<section>

## Consciousness and Words ##

> What about consciousness?  Is the Son the understanding of
> consciousness?  Is he the consciousness of the Father?  Is he the
> consciousness of consciousness?  Well, the supreme wisdom is
> undeniably conscious of itself.  It would be most appropriate,
> therefore, to understand the Father in terms of consciousness and
> the son in terms of word.  Words, after all, seem to be born from
> consciousness.
> (§48)

</section>
<section>

## Consciousness and Love ##

> Self-consciousness and self-understanding are not due to self-
> love.  But rather self-love happens because of self-consciousness
> and self-understanding.  Self-love is impossible without self-
> consciousness.  It is impossible without self-understanding.
> Nothing is loved without being the object of consciousness and
> understanding.
> (§50)

</section>
<section>

## Negative Theology ##

> What we do, when we cannot, or will not, utter something
> properly, is to signify it by means of something else---a riddle
> for example.
> (§65)

</section>
<section>

> Conclusion: the supreme nature is ineffable, because it simply
> cannot be made known as it is by means of words.  But a claim
> about the supreme nature, if one can be made that is dictated by
> reason and is state indirectly---in a riddle, as it were---is not
> false.
> (§65)

</section>
<section>

## Conscious Mind as Highest Likeness ##

> The efficacy of the mind's ascent to knowledge of the supreme
> nature is in direct proportion to the enthusiasm of its intent to
> learn about itself.  And, insofar as it forgets to look to
> itself, it falls from its reflection on the supreme nature.
> (§66)

</section>
<section>

## Our Purpose ##

> What the rational creation ought to do is put all its power and
> all its will into becoming conscious of, understanding and loving
> the supreme good.  This is what rational creation recognizes that
> its existence is for.
> (§68)

> To reject the supreme good is to rush headlong into eternal
> unhappiness.
> (§71)
