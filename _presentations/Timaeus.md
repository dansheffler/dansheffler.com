> What is that which always is and has no becoming, and what is
> that which becomes but never is?  The former is apprehended by
> understanding which involves a reasoned account.  It is
> unchanging.  The latter is grasped by opinion, which involves
> unreasoning sense perception.  It becomes and passes away, but
> never really is.
> (27e--28a)

> Well, if this world of ours is beautiful and its craftsman good,

> [the world] has come to be:  It is a work of craft, modeled after

> that is, by wisdom.
