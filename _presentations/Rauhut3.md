## Epistemology ##


</section>
<section>

## Types of Knowledge ##

1. Propositional Knowledge
2. Know How
3. Knowledge by Acquaintance

</section>
<section>

## Knowledge and Belief ##

<aside class="notes">
Perhaps raise the discussion question whether there is something wrong with believing things on insufficient evidence.

# Defining Knowledge #

</section>
<section>

## Knowledge Presuppoes Belief ##

(Belief is therefore a NECESSARY CONDITION for knowledge)

</section>
<section>

## More than Strong Belief ##

<aside class="notes">
Rauhut gives a good example of strongly believing that I have not won the lottary.  This falls short of genuine knowledge.
</aside>
</section>
<section>

## True and False ##

</section>
<section>

## Guessing ##

</section>
<section>

> It is safe to say that knowing $p$ requires some form of
> justification for the belief that $p$ is likely to be true.

</section>
<section>

## The Classical Definition ##

1. Belief
2. Truth
3. Justification

(Independently necessary and Joinly Sufficient)

<aside class="notes">
Practice this definition with the FFT on 46--47 (the answers will depend on the student's own knowledge).

## Global vs. Local ##

<section data-background="https://kenanmalik.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/frans-hals-descartes.jpg">

## René Descartes ##

(Just so we're clear: Descartes was not a skeptic;  He gave himself the project of completely *defeating* skepticism.)

</section>
<section>

Are there beliefs that are beyond the possibility of doubt?

<aside class="notes">
Perhaps use the set of propositions on page 52 as examples.
</aside>
</section>
<section>

## Dream Argument ##

1. If it is possible that I am dreaming right now, then I have
   reason to doubt whether my current perceptual beliefs are true.
2. It is possible that I am dreaming right now.

$\therefore$ I have reason to doubt whether my current perceptual beliefs are true.

## Stronger Versions ##

- Evil Spirit
- Brain in a Vat
- *The Matrix*

## The *Cogito* ##

> After having reflected well and carefully examined all things, we
> must come to the definite conclusion that this proposition: I am,
> I exist, is necessarily true each time that I pronounce it.

</section>
<section>

## Solipsism ##

> The position...which asserts that we can know only the contents
> of our own minds.

</section>
<section>

## Lower the Standard? ##

> It might be quite reasonable to say that I am justified to
> believe that $p$ is the case even if there is a chance that the
> justification for my belief in $p$ will later be defeated by
> additional evidence.

# Empiricism #

## British Roots ##

## Empiricism and Science ##

</section>
<section>

## The Challenge ##

The empiricist needs to establish:

> Whenever we perceive an object $P$ to have a property $A$, then
> object $P$ has indeed property $A$.

Call this thesis "perceptual realism"

<aside class="notes">
Perhaps pause here and ask whether the students accept this thesis right off the bat.  Why or why not?

## Perceptual Realism ##

1. Naïve Realism
2. Indirect Realism
3. Idealism

## Democritus ##

> By convention, sweet; by convention bitter; by convention, hot;
> by convention, cold; by convention, color; but in reality, atoms
> and void.

But indirect realism makes empiricism hard to defend

## Berkeley's Route: Idealism ##

> Esse est percepi (to be is to be perceived)

Perhaps pause here to ask about "if a tree falls in the forest..."

## Numbers as Example ##

<aside class="notes">
Rauhut gives a good example about knowing that there is no largest natural number.  Perhaps ask the students what they think.  Can we *know* such things?
</aside>
</section>
<section>

> rationalists claim that when we think about certain propositions,
> we can immediately understand and grasp that the propositions
> must be true.

(This is called a "self-evident" proposition)

<aside class="notes">
It would be really good to go through the food for thought on page 68.
