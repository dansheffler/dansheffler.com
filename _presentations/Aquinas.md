</section>
<section>

## Is the Existence of God Self-Evident? ##

> I answer that, a thing can be self-evident in either of two ways:
> on the one hand, self-evident in itself, though not to us; on the
> other hand, self-evident in itself and to us.
> (Q. 2, a. 1)

## Image of God ##

> Man is said to be in the image of God, not as regards his body,
> but as regards that whereby he excels other animals...Now man
> excels all animals by his reason and intellect; hence it is
> according to his intellect and reason, which are incorporeal,
> that man is said to be in the image of God.
> (Q. 3, a. 2)

</section>
<section>

## No Definition of God ##

> ...From this it is also plain that He has no genus or difference,
> nor can there be any definition of him; nor, save through His
> effects, a demonstration of Him; for a definition is from genus
> and difference, and the means of a demonstration is a definition.
> (Q. 3, a. 6)

# Question 12 #

</section>
<section>

## God is Excessively Intelligible ##

> What is supremely knowable in itself may not be knowable to a
> particular intellect, because of the excess of the intelligible
> object above the intellect;  as, for example, the sun, which is
> supremely visible, cannot be seen by the bat by reason of its
> excess of light.
> (Q. 12, a. 1)

</section>
<section>

## We Cannot Comprehend God ##

> ...Hence, it does not follow that He cannot be known at all, but
> that He transcends all knowledge; which means that He is not
> comprehended.
> (Q. 12, a 1)

</section>
<section>

## Grace ##

> Therefore, a created intellect cannot see the essence of God
> unless God by His grace unites Himself to the created intellect,
> as an object made intelligible to it.
> (Q. 12, a. 4)

</section>
<section>

## More and Less ##

> ...Hence the intellect which has more of the light of glory will
> see God the more perfectly.  But he will have a fuller
> participation of the light of glory who has more love, because
> where there is the greater love, there is more desire, and desire
> in a certain manner makes the one desiring apt and prepared to
> receive the object desired.
> (Q. 12, a. 6)

</section>
<section>

## Fulfillment of Desire ##

> In seeing [God, the blessed] possess Him as pressent, having the
> power to see Him always; and possessing Him, they enjoy Him as
> the ultimate fulfillment of desire.
> (Q. 12, a. 7)

# Questions 44--45 #

</section>
<section>

## Being by Participation ##

> Therefore all beings other than God are not their own being, but
> are beings by participation.
> (Q. 44, a. 1)

</section>
<section>

## The Greek Achievement ##

> Then others advanced further and raised themselves to the
> consideration of being as being, and who assigned a cause to
> things, not only according as they are *these* or *such*, but
> according as they are *beings*.
> (Q. 44, a. 3)

</section>
<section>

## Forms as Ideas in the Mind of God ##

> But the Forms, according to Augustine, are "the master forms
> which are contained in the divine intelligence.  Therefore, the
> exemplars of things are not outside God.
> (Q. 44, a. 4)

</section>
<section>

## Generosity of Creation ##

> He alone is the most perfectly generous giver, because He does
> not act for His own profit, but only out of His own goodness.

<section>

## Creation *Ex Nihilo* ##

> first principle be considered, it is impossible that any being
> should be presupposed to this emanation.
> (Q. 45, a. 2)
