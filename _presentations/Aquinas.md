## Image of God ##

> Man is said to be in the image of God, not as regards his body,
> but as regards that whereby he excels other animals...Now man
> excels all animals by his reason and intellect; hence it is
> according to his intellect and reason, which are incorporeal,
> that man is said to be in the image of God.
> (Q. 3, a. 2)

## No Definition of God ##

> ...From this it is also plain that He has no genus or difference,
> nor can there be any definition of him; nor, save through His
> effects, a demonstration of Him; for a definition is from genus
> and difference, and the means of a demonstration is a definition.
> (Q. 3, a. 6)
