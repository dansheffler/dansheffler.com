tags: [Theology, Hildebrand]
summary: The opposite of the self-righteous man is not the sinner but the saint.  The saint can be humble in his righteousness only because he walks in a deep awareness of grace.

Here we see drawn together several important observations about humility and sin.  People often say that they are "only human" or that "nobody's perfect."  The underlying thought is that humility requires this belief and that means they must accept the fact that they will go on sinning.  Here, however, we have the important distinction between an awareness of our frailty and a complacency with our sin.  The Christian ideal requires full repentance from sin *and at the same time* an awareness of our own weakness and former sin.

We will always find it psychologically impossible to hold these two ends together so long as we conceive the moral struggle in solitary terms.  If I, like the ancient ethical Greek, attempt to train virtue within myself under my own power and with my own solitary resources, I must inevitably lapse into either despair (because I keep on failing) or pharisaism (because I convince myself that I am morally excellent in a way that others are not).  Only by introducing a deep awareness of supernatural grace can the Christian saint simultaneously walk free from sin *and* walk in humility toward others.  This awareness only becomes possible once we step out of ethical solitude into an I--Thou encounter with a holy and merciful God.
