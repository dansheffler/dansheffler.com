title: One Thought Per Note
---

When using the Zettelkasten Method to organize my notes, I have found it important that each note file contains only a single idea.[^tkn]  I try to take this single thought and articulate it in as clearly as possible.  This may take anywhere from 50 to 500 words.  After I have spelled out the single idea I now have a mental hook that I can attach other ideas and pieces of information to---and this becomes more useful the more specific the hook.  For instance, suppose I kept all my thoughts about Plato in a single file.  Whenever I want to connect a thought to this information I would add a link: `[[Plato]]`.  But this link could refer to *anything* within my Plato research.  As it stands, however, I have split my research into bits as fine as possible while still maintaining the intergrity and coherence of the ideas.  The specific thought that Plato's account of tripartition in the *Republic* arises out of a need to explain internal motivational conflict goes into a single file.  In other notes I can refer to this specific thought with a link: `[[Plato - Tripartition - Internal Conflict]]`.  

This also gives me a way to manage my references to secondary literature.  As I'm reading Lloyd Gerson's article "A Note on Tripartition and Immortality in Plato," I find that he talks about this subject on pages 85 and 86.[@gerson01]  So I add a brief quote and a few comments to the bottom of a section labeled "References" in the note.  If I had not split up my notes on Plato into fine-grained topics, I would have trouble knowing where to put this information and I would have more trouble finding it again when I need to know what Gerson says about this specific topic.  The "References" section in the note is already populated by several other references to secondary literature.  This way, when I go to write the paragraph in Chapter 4 of my dissertation that deals with the link between tripartition and motivational conflict I have already prepared both my own position and a list of references to my sources.
