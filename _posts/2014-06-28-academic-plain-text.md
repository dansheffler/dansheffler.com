Many of my colleagues ask how I set up my system for authoring in
Markdown with its automatically formated citations and easy output
to PDF, DOCX, and HTML, but the learning curve can be quite steep
and many are scared away when I say things like "command line." I
recently found this excellent [article][] over at the Programming
Historian. It assumes next to no knowledge about the tools
involved, starting at the very beginning. It is more useful for my
purposes than many of the Markdown guides out there because it is
written by an academic for other academics, so the guide includes
things like Pandoc's footnotes and citations (which are extensions
of standard markdown).
