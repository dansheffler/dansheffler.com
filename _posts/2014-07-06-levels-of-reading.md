title: Levels of Reading
---

In a previous post I mentioned that I like to take marginal notes when I want to engage deeply with a text.  This is quite time consuming because I stop to evaluate each paragraph and think about how to summarize it.  This kind of reading is only appropriate for a relatively small portion of the books that I read.  I learned from A.G. Sertillanges's book, *The Intellectual Life*, that it is a mistake to read books with a higher level of attention than they deserve.  His prescription is quite systematic, distinguishing four distinct categories of reading.[@sertillanges87 152] I would simply suggest that we should adjust the tools and degree of annotation to the text at hand and our research purposes for it.  Seneca makes much the same point:

> Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed and
> some few to be chewed and digested; that is, some books
> are to be read only in parts; others to be read, but
> curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and with
> diligence and attention.[@empty Quote taken from the excellent [Taking Note](http://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2007/12/seneca-on-gathering-ideas.html) blog.]

After spending quite a bit of time working out a digital annotation system, I face the danger of wanting to apply it to everything I read.  This transforms into what Sertillanges diagnoses as an inordinate lust for collecting information:

> Some people have so many and such full notebooks that they are
> prevented by a sort of anticipatory discouragement from ever
> opening them.  Their imaginary treasures have cost much time
> and trouble, and they yield no return.

More to come on note-taking in general.
