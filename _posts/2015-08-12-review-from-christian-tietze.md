Title: Review from Christian Tietze
---

This week Christian Tietze over at [Zettelkasten.de](http://zettelkasten.de) wrote up two helpful reviews of my note taking methods: (i) [this post](http://zettelkasten.de/posts/dan-sheffler-notes/) discusses the advantages of keeping notes in a notebook and (ii) [this post](http://zettelkasten.de/posts/dan-sheffler-workflow/) discusses my recent description of moving from reading to organized notes on the computer.

I discovered Christian and Sascha's work on this site only recently, but I have already learned a lot, so head over there and check out what they have to say about taking notes.
