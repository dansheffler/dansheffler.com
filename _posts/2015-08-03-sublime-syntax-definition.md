title: Sublime Syntax Definition
tags: [Sublime, markdown, Writing, Zettlekasten]
summary: My own Sublime syntax definition that includes zettlekasten linmks.
---

I have just created a syntax definition for Sublime Text 3 that
slightly extends the wonderful [Academic
Markdown](https://github.com/mangecoeur/AcademicMarkdown), which is
itself an extension of [Markdown
Editing](https://github.com/mangecoeur/AcademicMarkdown).  All that
I have added is a definition for my own wiki-style links.  As an
example, the link syntax looks like this: `[[Philebus - Four
Kinds]]`. With the color scheme that comes with Academic Markdown
this gives the links a nice blue:

The whole thing is rather long, so I'll just provide a link to the
[gist](https://gist.github.com/8244c6279a74bedbc9e2).  Save this as
a file in your Sublime Text `User` folder and you should be able to
set this as the default syntax for all files with the `.md`
extension (or whatever you use).
