The first half of this claim is the main concern of my current book project, but the second half is more interesting, although it requires a little explaining.  I take Zizioulas to mean that, although we are individual humans automatically, being a fully fledged *person* is something we must grow into as we come into deeper and deeper communion with God, so the "living reality" of being a person must come from Christianity.  But can we really say that this living reality is "purely the product of patristic thought"?  As much as I like the Fathers, this doesn't seem quite right.  Perhaps better to say, "purely the product of the Faith expressed in patristic thought"?
