I was pleased to see my review of the recently republished [*Liturgy and Personality*](https://www.amazon.com/Liturgy-Personality-Dietrich-von-Hildebrand/dp/1939773008) by Dietrich von Hildebrand (Hildebrand Press) in this month's *Touchstone*.  You can read the short review online [here](http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=30-03-055-b).  If you are at all interested in the ways that worship shapes and forms us at the deepest level, I highly recommend this short but dense book.

I'm also very much looking forward to this year's [Hildebrand Project Summer Seminar](http://www.hildebrandproject.org/events/seventh-annual-summer-seminar-retrieving-beauty#).  This year, the focus will be on beauty and the line-up of faculty looks quite good.
