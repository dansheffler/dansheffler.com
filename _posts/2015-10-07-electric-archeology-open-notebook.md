title: Electric Archeology Open Notebook
---

I'm really impressed with what Shawn Grahm over at Electric
Archeology is doing with the Sublime Zettelkasten plugin.  He is
using [Pykwiki](http://pykwiki.nullism.com/) to create a static site
from his local folder of markdown files so that he can host an [open notebook](http://electricarchaeology.ca/2015/10/06/an-elegant-open-notebook/). You should really go over and check it out.
