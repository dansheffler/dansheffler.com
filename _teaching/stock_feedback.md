Make sure that you carefully proofread your writing.  There are several noticeable errors.

In general, your writing could use one more pass of proofreading as there are several errors that detract from the professionalism of your presentation.

Throughout, there are a number of grammar errors that obscure your meaning. This makes it difficult to follow the logic of what you are saying. Try to go over your writing more thoroughly.

Main area for improvement: diction.  Many of the words that you use do not mean what you seem to think they mean.  This often comes from students attempting to speak in a more sophisticated voice than they have truly mastered or attempting to use technical terms that they do not really understand.

You could stand to give this paper one more proofread as there are a few errors that slightly detract from the professionalism of the writing.

Try to proofread your writing more carefully.  Your first sentence, for example, is not grammatical, which makes it difficult to understand what you mean right from the beginning.

Avoid contractions in academic writing.

Book titles are italicized but not surrounded by quotation marks.

These days, book titles are italicized rather than underlined.  (The underlining convention comes from the days of typewriters, when typing italics was very difficult.)

Chapter titles are capitalized, surrounded by quotation marks, but not italicized.

"God" is capitalized whenever it is used as a proper noun.

Check the difference between a plural noun and a possessive noun formed with an apostrophe.

Check the difference between "then" and "than."

In American publishing, the period goes before a closing quotation mark (both single and double).  The Brits do it the other way around.

Avoid rhetorical questions.

Expressions from foreign languages are put in italics.




## Length ##

Try to meet the 250 word requirement in each section independently.

Make sure that each section independently meets the word count (250 words).

Just one more sentence in your analysis section would give you an A in this category.

In a short paper like this, avoid long quotations, especially when you do not meet the word count on your own.

Try to meet the word count.  Just a few more sentences in both sections and you would have an A in this category.


## Analysis ##

#### Positive ####

Good job identifying a specific claim in the very first sentence.

Good job identifying a specific claim by the author.  This can be even better by figuring out a way to put that claim in the very first sentence.

You also do a good job confining yourself to specific points that support this main thesis rather than veering off into summary.


#### Negative ####

In your analysis, you need to identify a specific thesis from the author in the very first sentence and limit the rest of the paragraph to reasons that specifically support this thesis.

It is not immediately apparent from your first paragraph what conclusion you have identified from the text and which premises you have selected that support this conclusion.  Make sure that you are not summarizing.

Make sure that the rest of your analysis paragraph sticks to the premises that support the conclusion you have chosen.  Avoid a bullet point list of interesting themes and pieces of information.  Instead, explain the logical connection between the author's thesis and his supporting points.


## Response ##

#### Negative ####

Similarly, in your response avoid giving a series of impressions.  Instead, adopt a specific argumentative stance in response to the author's conclusion and support this stance with definite reasons.  (That is, give an argument of your own complete with conclusion and premises.)

Try to avoid, however, narrating your personal thought process or impressions about the text.  Instead stick to objective reasons that could be persuasive to any reasonable person (not just you).


#### Positive ####

Your response section is quite good.  You take a definite stand and you support that position with clear, definite reasons.

In the response section, you do a good job taking a stand and defending that position with definite reasons.
