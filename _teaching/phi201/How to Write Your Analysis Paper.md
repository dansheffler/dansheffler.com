## How to Write Your Analysis Paper ##


For the midterm and the final you will need to write an analysis paper on one of the authors we have read.  For the midterm you can pick any reading from the ancient portion of the course, and for the final you can pick any reading from the medieval portion.  You may also ask me for permission to do another reading besides what is assigned (I am usually fine with it as long as it is a primary source which is relevant and rigorous).  Once you have picked what you want, here are the steps to writing an A paper:

1. **Read**. Reading philosophy is hard. You cannot expect to read
   30 pages of the stuff the way you read a novel or a blog.  You
   will need to read most paragraphs at least twice before you
   understand them, usually more.  When I read philosophy, I
   usually budget about one hour for every ten pages.  Make sure
   that you take notes on the flow of the argument.  Identify
   specific truth claims in the text and which logical moves are
   being made to support them.  Diagramming the argument often
   helps.
2. **Identify a Thesis**.  Find one specific claim in the reading
   that you want to focus on.  This must be an actual thesis rather
   than merely a theme the author discusses or question he raises.
   Begin your paper with an explicit statement of this thesis---
   literally the first sentence of your paper must be this or you
   will have points taken off. Here is a model sentence that you
   should use, replacing the pieces as necessary: "In the
   *Nichomachean Ethics*, Aristotle claims that happiness is the
   exercise of virtue." Here are some examples of what does
   ***NOT*** count as a thesis:
   (i)   "In the *Nichomachean Ethics*, Aristotle discusses the
         important idea of virtue."
   (ii)  "In the *Nichomachean Ethics*, Aristotle wonders what
         exactly it would take to become virtuous."
   (iii) "I chose to write my paper about Aristiadles book
         *Nichomalan Ethiks*.  I lovd it!1!"
3. **Identify Premises**.  Find at least three facts, that is
   definite truth claims, that support the thesis that you have
   identified.  Your task is not to outline the chapter.  In all
   likelihood the author talks about a lot of things that do not
   directly support the thesis you have chosen.  If you find
   yourself writing something like "he goes on to discuss" you are
   probably "summarizing" rather than analyzing an argument.
   Instead, focus exclusively on specific claims that definitely
   support the thesis.  If you cannot find at least three
   supporting claims, you need to choose a different thesis.  Write
   out these supporting claims in the clearest, most concise
   writing you can manage.
4. **Identify Logic**.  Work out for yourself the logical
   connection between the supporting points and the thesis.  Ask
   yourself what kind of evidence they offer for it and why.
   *Explain* this connection in definite sentences.  Once you have
   done this, you should easily have exceeded the 500 word count
   for the analysis section.
5. **Take a Stand**.  Figure out where *you* stand on the issue.
   Do you think that the thesis you picked is *true* or *false*?
   In the first sentence of your argumentative reflection section
   make a definite claim.  Here is an example: "While Aristotle
   is correct to think that virtue and happiness are related, he is incorrect to think that the former is the exercise of the latter."  Do ***NOT*** talk about whether you liked the reading,
   how good the author was, whether the examples were clear etc.
   Your job is to make a philosophical *argument* of your own
   rather than act as an art critic.  Do not narrate your personal
   reaction or thought process.  Instead, focus on an objective
   claim.  I call this "staying objective."
6. **Craft an Argument**.  Think up at least three supporting
   pieces of evidence for why another rational human being should
   agree that the claim you just wrote in step 5 is the truth.  You
   don't have to *prove* beyond all doubt that your claim is the
   truth (there will always be *someone* who disagrees).  Instead
   you should strive to find pieces of evidence that are good
   enough that if a reasonable person were to accept your evidence
   they would be hard pressed not to draw the same conclusion as
   you.
7. **Clean Up**.  Give both the analysis section and the
   argumentative response section a label so that I can clearly see
   where one ends and the other begins.  Make sure that each
   section meets the length requirement of 500 words.  I will not
   accept papers that are not long enough, and you will have points
   deducted for lateness until you turn in a long enough paper.
   Double check the names of authors and titles (seriously, people
   get this wrong all the time and it looks really bad).  Titles of books, even the short dialogues of Plato, go in italics.  Read the
   entire piece out loud to yourself and make sure that each of
   your sentences is grammatical and actually makes sense.  Replace
   any big or technical words that you yourself don't understand.
   Double check things like placement of commas, possessive
   apostrophes, usage of contractions, passive voice, ambiguous
   pronouns etc. If you need help with this last bit, bring a draft
   of your paper to office hours and I will read it over with you.


Below you will find the rubric I use in grading these papers.  On some parts, you can get partial credit for what I judge to be a solid effort.  On the grammar part, I simply take one point off for every error I see to a limit of 20.
