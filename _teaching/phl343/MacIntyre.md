## MacIntyre - *After Virtue* ##

### 9. Nietzsche or Aristotle? ###

Throughout the book, MacIntyre argues against "Weberian" ethics (named after Max Weber) that, according to MacIntyre, promotes burocracy and managment of individuals over virtue and community.

The vary use of the idea of "ideology" is itself an arbitrary preference on the part of Marxists.   
[Page 110](sk://macintyre07#132)

Morality is being "used."  *Whose* is it?   
[Page 110](sk://macintyre07#132)

Modern moral (and political) discourse is broken and incoherent because it is only fragments of an earlier living tradition (Divine law, teleology).   
[Page 111](sk://macintyre07#133)

Taboo rules become unintelligible when their original context is forgotten.   
[Page 112](sk://macintyre07#134)

We could not simply apply analytic philosophy to the taboo concept as it stands---it has already become unintelligible.   
[Page 112](sk://macintyre07#134)

What we need is to understand the historical situation and recover the context in which this morality makes sense.   
[Page 112](sk://macintyre07#134)

Nietzsche presents a genuine option: simply get rid of morality.   
[Page 113](sk://macintyre07#135)

Nietzsche represents individualism taken to its logical extreme.  The individual renounces a *rational* justification for his morality and instead grounds value on the heroic act of his own *will*.   
[Page 114](sk://macintyre07#136)

Nietzsche is *the* moral philosopher of the bureaucratic age.   
[Page 114](sk://macintyre07#136)

Aristotle rejects the idea that success equals whatever passes for success.   
[Page 116](sk://macintyre07#138)

In ancient societies honor could be *deserved* precisely because there was a real objective moral order of values.   
[Page 116](sk://macintyre07#138)

Aristotle's moral framework was rejected during the Enlightenment, but the project of building a new framework during the Enlightenment failed.  From this failure we get Nietzsche.  But this leads us to another possibility: were we right in the first place as a society to reject the Aristotelian framework?   
[Page 117](sk://macintyre07#139)

MacIntyre's thesis is not historical.  He is only talking about Aristotelianism (as opposed to other ancient philosophies) because it is the philosophically strongest.   
[Page 118](sk://macintyre07#140)

All Enlightenment modes of thought fail to answer (or even really raise) the question: "What sort of person am I to become?"

An yet we *necessarily* give an answer to this question in practice by the way we choose to live our lives.   
[Page 118](sk://macintyre07#140)

Modern liberal philosophy is about *rules* because questions about the "good life for man" are (according to Dworkin) "systematically unsettlable."  This claim from Dworkin should remind us of what we just read from Berlin.  Because of Berlin's pessimism about harmonizing human goods, the best we should hope for is a system of rules so that we don't violate each other's rights.   
[Page 119](sk://macintyre07#141)

We should be interested not just in Aristotle's own texts, but in the whole tradition of "Aristotelianism" that inspires a virtue-oriented way of thinking.

### 18. After Virtue: Nietzsche or Aristotle, Trotsky and St. Benedict ###

Premise One: Modern moral thinking is in total disarray because it has become separated from a world-view in which it makes sense.   
[Page 256](sk://macintyre07#278)

Premise Two: Ever since the Enlightenment rejection of Aristotelianism, modern alternatives have failed to provide rational grounds for morality.   
[Page 256](sk://macintyre07#278)

Modern morality is best understood as a set of fragmented survivals from the earlier Aristotelian position.

In Aristotelian thought, rules only make sense within the larger framework of virtue-oriented thinking.   
[Page 257](sk://macintyre07#279)

Nietzsche's idea of the "ubermensch" relies on the idea that all European moralities are just fake masks to disguise people trying to get power.  This ignores, however, the way the morality is something we specifically learn *in community*, and that human goods are only achievable *in community*.   
[Page 258](sk://macintyre07#280)

Nietzsche's "Great-Man" "represents individualism's final attempt to escape from its own consequences."  It is the logical conclusion of "liberal individualist society."   
[Page 259](sk://macintyre07#281)

> It is therefore after all the case that the crucial moral opposition is between liberal individualism in some version or other and the Aristotelian tradition in some version or other.
> [@macintyre07 [page 258](sk://macintyre07#280)]   
[Page 259](sk://macintyre07#281)

Three sets of opponents:

(1) Liberal individualists,
(2) Aristotelians who think MacIntyre hasn't gone far enough,
(3) Anti-Liberals who are also Anti-Aristotelians (postmodernists/Marxists).

Despite surface appearances, Marxism actually contains a core of radical individualism.   
[Page 261](sk://macintyre07#283)

Marxism has been totally exhausted now as a political tradition---and so has *every other* modern political tradition.  But this should not lead us to a general political pessimism.   
[Page 262](sk://macintyre07#284)

Parallel between our own time and the collapse of the Roman Empire.  At that time "men and women of good will turned aside from the task of shoring up the Roman *imperium* and ceased to identify the continuation of civility and moral community with the maintenance of that *imperium*."  Instead, they committed themselves to "the construction of new forms of community within which the moral life could be sustained so that both morality and civility might survive the coming ages of barbarism and darkness."

> What matters at this stage is the construction of local forms of community within which civility and the intellectual and moral life can be sustained through the new dark ages which are already upon us.  And if the tradition of the virtues was able to survive the horrors of the last dark ages, we are not entirely without grounds for hope.  This time however the barbarians are not waiting beyond the frontiers; they have already been governing us for quite some time.  And it is our lack of consciousness of this that constitutes part of our predicament.  We are waiting not for Godot, but for another---doubtless very different---St. Benedict.
