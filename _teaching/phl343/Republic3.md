### Plato - *Republic* III ###

What aspects of Socrates's program of censorship are we to take literally? Does Plato really not like the poets as much as this makes it seem?

Notice that many of the objections that Adeimantus raised back in Book II were based on what the poets and other authorities say.  The censorship policies that Socrates is getting Adeimantus to agree to are systematically undermining that way of thinking.

How much do *we* think the contents of what we *hear* determine *who we are*?

Part of the problem of such representations in art is that they provide an *example* for the formation of our character. (E.g. if it wasn't shameful for Achilles to act in blind rage is isn't for me either) (388d). Socrates's point seems to be that *which* examples we set before us as formative ought to be subject to some principle of *rational selection*.

What do we think about the exclusive right of the rulers to use deception as a kind of medicine? (389c)

The greatest lie of all is that unjust men are often (or even sometimes) happy (392b). The whole task of the *Republic* is to deal with this lie.

Socrates adds a little more specification to the principle we noted in Book II. The reason human beings are not self-sufficient is that human nature is finely subdivided so that it is impossible to play many roles well (395b).

This is because *what we do* becomes ingrained in *who we are* as we form habits that become second nature (395d).

Notice that it is not against representation and imitation as such that Socrates objects, it is only to the imitation of evil because this becomes a model for the good man's character (396d).

Notice that there is a way of coming out on the other side of the feverish pursuit of luxury (399e). By trimming back and excluding certain elements on a rational basis the new city is now neither a city of primitivism (the city of pigs) nor a city of unbridled expansion (the second city).

At 405b Socrates gives a very abbreviated form of his answer to Glaucon's challenge. A man who is unjust is made a slave to others and depends on something external to impose order in his life. The just man, however, has order and self-rule in his own soul. Self-rule is taken as axiomatically better than external rule, and this seems to be a foundational principle in Western political thought.

The story about Herodicus may be a parable for a certain way of pursuing justice and politics. There is a way of proceeding in life that does everything under the sun necessary to keep a system from failing but nothing to make it really excellent (think of our modern economic predicament). Socrates calls this method "dying a lingering death" (406b).

As we frame the new city, then, we must not just think about how to survive and how to get as much as possible (like the second city) we must attend to those things that make life *worth living* (406d). Socrates's answer is that what makes a man's life worth living is his *proper task*, his life's work.

The best judges are those with a pure soul (409a).

Notice the introduction of a central question in political philosophy: Who will rule and who will be ruled? (412b)

Rule must be based in care and love and this in turn is found when we have identity of interests (412d):

> And wouldn't he surely love something most when he believed
> that the same things are advantageous to it and to himself, and
> when he supposed that if it did well, he too himself would do
> well along with it, and if it didn't neither would he?

The first rule from the gods to the rulers is that the *watch the character* in the children of their state. This is to qualify people for rule and nothing else (415b).  This is in contrast to hereditary rule.

Notice that Socrates does not exclude private property and currency from the city as a whole, only from the rulers and auxiliaries (417b). It is dangerous to mix rule with any other motive alien to the *care for the good of the city* (cf. 412).
