## Mill Part I ##

**Primary question**: how much power can society legitimately have over the individual (7).

Ancient political thought is characterized by the assumption that the rulers necessarily stand in an antagonistic relationship with the people ruled (8).

Once self-government or government *by the people* came about, people thought that there was no longer any need to limit the powers of the government because there was no danger that the interests of the government would stand against those of the people. This is, of course, false because the people *as a whole* may grossly violate the rights of *an individual* (9--10).

The tyranny of the majority is not limited to the official acts of the government. It is often most potent as the background force of public opinion (10).

Rules for living with one another cannot be grounded on mere taste (12).

**Fundamental rule**: Compulsion is only justified by self-defense (16).

Harm which warrants self-defense must be direct (18).
