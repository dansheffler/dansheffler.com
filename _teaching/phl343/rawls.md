## Rawls - "The Right and the Good Contrasted" ##

Violation of rights is compatible with classic utilitarianism
[Page 37](sk://rawls84#1)

Utilitarianism conceives of society as a whole as a rational agent.
[Page 38](sk://rawls84#2)

There is a fundamental similarity between this kind of maximization and economic forms.
[Page 38](sk://rawls84#2)

"Utilitarianism does not take seriously the distinction between persons."
[Page 38](sk://rawls84#2)

The justice perspective, however, gives a certain sphere of inviolability to the individual.
[Page 39](sk://rawls84#3)

Justice as fairness takes the plurality of distinct persons with their "separate systems of ends" as a constitutive feature of human society.
[Page 40](sk://rawls84#4)

Justice as fairness is a non-teleological theory whereas utilitarianism is.
[Page 40](sk://rawls84#4)

Deontological does not mean "not taking consequences into accont" it means "non-teleological."
[Page 41](sk://rawls84#5)

The good is defined as the "satisfaction of rational desire," but on Rawls's theory, there is no guarantee that a *just* arrangement will maximize this. Hence, there is a fundamental difference between the *right* and the *good*.

This model of the good is insensitive to the various qualities of desires. It doesn't matter what the desire is *for* only how its satisfaction will affect overall well-being.
[Page 41](sk://rawls84#5)

The right is *prior* to the good.
[Page 42](sk://rawls84#6)

That certain desires should not be fulfilled in the utilitarian system depends on contingent facts about the human situation. Under Rawls's view, there are some desires, the satisfaction of which is wrong from the outset.
[Page 42](sk://rawls84#6)

A common sense view (or that of Aristotle) is that goods should be distributed according to moral merit. "Justice is happiness according to virtue."
[Page 44](sk://rawls84#8)

Distinction between moral desert and legitimate expectation.
[Page 44](sk://rawls84#8)

No one *deserves* his place in the distribution of assets.
[Page 45](sk://rawls84#9)

Justice does not aim to reward virtue.
[Page 45](sk://rawls84#9)

Rewarding desert is incompatible with the prioritization of *need*.
[Page 45](sk://rawls84#9)

Further, the concept of moral worth only emerges *after* we have conceived of justice.
[Page 46](sk://rawls84#10)

Justice as fairness does not reward moral worth, but it does give each his "due" as the system of justice simply defines "due" as what can be legitimately expected.
[Page 46](sk://rawls84#10)

Distributive justice is not the opposite of retributive justice. But this is just what the believers in moral desert think.
[Page 47](sk://rawls84#11)

retributive justice only exists in the just society because of the assurance problem.
[Page 48](sk://rawls84#12)

The principles of justice are chosen (rationally) but the principles of rationality are not. They are *given*.
[Page 48](sk://rawls84#12)

Further, we do not need to come to an agreement of what counts as "rational" in the original position.
[Page 49](sk://rawls84#13)

It is usually a good thing that people conceive of the good differently, but this is not so for their conception of the right.
[Page 49](sk://rawls84#13)

In our conception of the right, it is necessary that we come to some kind of agreement if we are to live in society together. There is no such agreement that must be reached with respect to our individual conceptions of the good.

Persons are left free to determine their own good and the opinions of others are merely advisory.

[Page 50](sk://rawls84#14)

Our life plan takes into account *our* particular circumstances, whereas the principles of justice must be choosen before this.
[Page 51](sk://rawls84#15)

Three versions of *hedonism*:

(i) the sole intrinsic good is pleasurable feeling.
(ii) the only thing individuals actually strive for is pleasure.
(iii) trying to carry though the dominant-end conception of deliberation.
[Page 53](sk://rawls84#17)

Pleasure as the dominant-end is compatible with striving for a great array of things. This is meant to avoid "fanaticism and inhumanity."
[Page 54](sk://rawls84#18)

Hedonism is easy to prove wrong. If "pleasure" is defined so as to be calculable it can no longer have a reasonable claim to being our dominant end.
[Page 55](sk://rawls84#19)

How are we to way pleasure and pain against one another? We must adopt a standard more fundamental than the two.
[Page 55](sk://rawls84#19)

The success of economics does not help the utilitarian.
[Page 56](sk://rawls84#20)

Pleasure was our only candidate for a dominant end and it has proven inadequate. QED there is no dominant end to be found.
[Page 56](sk://rawls84#20)

In a teleological theory, vagueness in the conception of the good transfers to the conception of the right.
[Page 56](sk://rawls84#20)

The turn to pleasure is an attempt to find a common denominator among different persons, "an interpersonal currency."
[Page 57](sk://rawls84#21)

It is not our particular ends that define what we are but the *principles* that govern which ends are to be pursued and how.
[Page 57](sk://rawls84#21)
