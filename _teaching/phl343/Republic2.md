### Plato - *Republic* II ###

The distinction Glaucon makes here between something we delight in for its own sake and something we delight in for the sake of something else is crucial for the rest of the *Republic*.  Make sure you pause here and really understand this idea before moving on.
(357b)

There is a striking similarity between the view put forward by Glaucon here (not his own view) and the social contract theories of Hobbes and Locke.  Try to remember carefully how this view comes under fire in the *Republic* and why.  A nice paper would be an application of Socrates's criticisms to Hobbes and Locke.
(358e--359a)

A major feature of Hobbes's view that is brought out here: Justice is only valuable because we can't do unmitigated wrong to one another without suffering redress.
(359b)

Pay close attention to the ring of Gyges story.  It is super important in the history of social and political philosophy.

Notice the phrase "iron strength of will" at (360b). The implication is that a good man in possession of an invisibility ring would not have the *self-control* to do the right thing. Does this really show what Glaucon thinks it shows (that justice is not intrinsically desirable), or only that people are weak-willed without constraints? This is a major question for the whole of the *Republic*.

"The most accomplished form of injustice is to seem just when you are not" (361a). Notice that it is a particular feature of injustice to capitalize on *seeming* rather than *being*.

Notice that the idea of buying off the gods is just what Cephalus seemed to be advocating in Book I.  What is wrong with this?  All of these comments seem to be getting at the idea that justice should be its own reward rather than relying on *external* sanctions like rewards and punishments.
(364)

Adeimantus's point can be put simply in Christian terms: if you can be forgiven your sins and thereby not face the eternal consequences, why not just go ahead and sin?
(364--365)

Adeimantus wants to know what justice and injustice do each "with its own power when it is in the soul of a man who possesses it" (366e).

Notice that Socrates suggests we look at justice in the community *in order to* figure out what justice is in the individual (369a). This should serve as a caution to our interpretive strategy in the rest of the *Republic*. When Socrates describes the laws of his ideas polis, is Plato really concerned with state-level politics, or is the whole thing a metaphor for justice in the individual, or perhaps a bit of both.

Why does Socrates think that looking at the *origin* of the city will help at all (369a)? We will ask similar things about Locke and Rousseau.

The city comes into being because individuals are not self-sufficient.  The idea of self-sufficiency---or the lack thereof---will be important for us this semester.  Is Socrates right about this claim?  It enters into the dialog without much discussion.
(369b)

Notice there is a transition around 367e between the description of the "first city" aka the "city of pigs" and the description of the "second city."  Some students miss that these are two *different* societies being described.  What are the differences between these two cities?  Reading through Socrates's irony, is there one of these that is better than the other?  Why?  Notice that the primitivism associated with the first city and the idealisation of it is connected with what we will read from Rousseau.

Socrates claims that cities continue to expand because people will never be "satisfied" (373a), but can we suppose that the people in the city of pigs would be any different?

Where does war originate and why?  Is Socrates right about this claim?

Why exactly do the cities warriors (aka "guardians") need to have philosophic natures?  And why in the world does Socrates pick the dog as the philosophical animal?
(375ff)
