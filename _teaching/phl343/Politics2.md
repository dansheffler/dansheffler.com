## Responses to Plato ##


Notice that we are proceeding with this inquiry under the assumption that we can "live exactly as we would like." The state we are investigating is therefore an ideal state rather than one colored by the constraints of particular situations (1260b).

A certain degree of plurality is natural to a state. If the state were maximally unified it would cease to be a state, that is it would cease to be an association *of individuals*. Conversely, if the state were maximally plural it would cease to be an *association* at all (1261a).

Rotation of office is a just form of distributing the ruler--ruled relationship among equals since it is not possible for everyone to rule simultaneously (1261b).

That which is most a unity is least self-sufficient (1261b).

Aristotle predicts the much later economic problem of the "tragedy of the commons" (1261b).
