## Taylor - "Atomism" ##

Atomism refers to any view in which the goods of society are conceived of primarily in terms of individual goods. In this way, society becomes primarily instrumental.    
[Page 1](sk://taylor85#1)

Atomistic theories take as binding the ascription of rights but do not take as fundamental the ascriptions of obligations.    
[Page 2](sk://taylor85#2)

It is striking that we even find it *plausible* to begin with the ascription of rights to individuals.   
[Page 3](sk://taylor85#3)

Living with others is a necessary condition for the development of rationality. This is important because rationality and autonomous agency are constitutive of what it means to be human. They are part of a person's "specifically human potential."   
[Page 5](sk://taylor85#5)

The problem is that we do not deny rights to those who lack this specifically human potential.    
[Page 5](sk://taylor85#5)

By turning our attention to the specifically human capacities which command our respect (and thus ground our sense of rights), we include everything we want from a system of rights,   
[Page 8](sk://taylor85#8)

Rights are therefore grounded in *essence*. Before we can figure out what someone has a right to or from we must figure out what sort of thing he is.
[Page 9](sk://taylor85#9)

Even for those who cannot fully develop these capacities, we have a deep sense that the human is never completely eradicated. Even the psychopath dreams human dreams and speaks a human language.   
[Page 10](sk://taylor85#10)

The far liberal position (represented by Mill) which places a central importance on the unrestricted right to a freedom to choose whatever life for myself that I wish is leery of this sense of obligation incurred by acknowledging these fundamentally valuable aspects of human nature. The caution is that if we incur obligations we will also give up some freedom.   
[Page 10](sk://taylor85#10)

But even this strong liberal position is rooted in a particular conception of ultimate worth: that of unrestricted freedom of choice. It thus advocates societies and structures that foster this capacity to choose and stands against institutions which stifle it.    
[Page 11](sk://taylor85#11)

But the development of these characteristics is not independent from the society in which the individual finds himself.   
[Page 11](sk://taylor85#11)

This social thesis (that our specifically human capacities cannot be fully developed apart from certain kinds of society) commits us to an *obligation to belong*.    
[Page 12](sk://taylor85#12)

If all we want is to ground a right to life in desire satisfaction as sentient beings, then perhaps we can defend a anti-social independence thesis. But if we admit that we also want other things like the freedom to choose life plans and to form moral convictions then we will need to admit that these things can be more or less developed and that they are more developed in certain kinds of society.   
[Page 16](sk://taylor85#16)

It is possible for a rights theorist to acknowledge all the societal obligations Taylor advocates but still maintain that these are only incurred by voluntary association. What Taylor needs is a stronger sense of natural obligation which we incur singly by being human.    
[Page 17](sk://taylor85#17)

We need the ability to sympathetically consider substantively different alternatives in order to exercise a full moral autonomy and this is difficult if not impossible to cultivate in the family alone. One needs a larger society in which there is a diversity of life.    
[Page 18](sk://taylor85#18)

If the right kind of society is only sustainable under certain political forms then we have a positive obligation to cultivate and protect these forms.    
[Page 21](sk://taylor85#21)

The free individual also incurs a responsibility to cultivate the whole moral tone of his society because his freedom only develops within a moral milieu in which freedom is valued.   
[Page 21](sk://taylor85#21)

Being free requires a conception of the self and this only develops in *conversation* with others.
