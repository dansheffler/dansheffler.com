Two different kinds of inequality: natural and political (77).

"They speak of savage man and they depict civilized man" (78). Rousseau's basic complaint is that the attempts of previous philosophers to talk of man's nature *prior* to participation in civilization is burdened with a host of concepts that are necessarily *posterior* to civilization. We will see whether Rousseau does any better than his predecessors.

The body of natural man is strong and robust by constant effort. He has all his needs easily met because he can eat just about anything in the forest. He measures "with his eyes the vast expanse of the heavens" (81--82).

"These are the fatal proofs that most of our ills are of our own making and that we might have avoided nearly all of them if only we had adhered to the simple unchanging and solitary way of life that nature ordained for us" (84--85).

"While nature alone activates everything in the operations of a beast man participates in his own actions in his capacity as a free agent" (87).

Notice the strong libertarian formulation of this freedom (88).  

All the vices and virtues of men follow from his *faculty of self-improvement* (88).

Progress of the mind generates in man new desires (89).

Not even the nuclear family is proper to the state of nature (92).

For Hobbes and Locke, even though there is a departure from the ancient tradition in the claim that man is *not* by nature political, they still hold that in the state of nature there is a strong and immediate inducement for man to enter into a political arrangement. For Rousseau, however, man in the state of nature is usually alone and has very little need of any other man. Nature contributes nothing or almost nothing to the invention of society (97).

Awareness of good and evil also only comes about in society. Man in a state of nature, therefore, cannot be wicked because he does not know what it is to be good (99).

The desire to have *one* mate is an artificial and societal addition to the natural desire for sex. It is from this additional desire that strife comes (102--103).

Oppression and servitude are inconceivable in the state of nature. Both because there is no benefit gained by oppressing another, and because it is nearly impossible to keep another in bondage (106).

"It is impossible to enslave a man without first putting him in a situation where he cannot do without another man" (106).
