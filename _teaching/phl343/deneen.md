### Deneen - "Unsustainable Liberalism" ###

Liberalism has to do with our conception of liberty.  Modern liberalism (Deneen claims) is deeply shaped by two factors:

(i) individualism/voluntarism
(ii) separation from/opposition to nature

Is he right about this claim?

According to liberalism...

> Human beings are by nature..."non-relational" creatures,
> separate and autonomous.  Liberalism thus begins a project by
> which the legitimacy of all human relationships---beginning
> with, but not limited to, political bonds---becomes
> increasingly subject to the criterion of whether or not they
> have been chosen, and chosen upon the basis of their service to
> rational self-interest.

Point: political theory does become wide-spread at the popular level and this changes the way that people think about themselves.

Teleological conception of man.

This is one of the main reasons I assigned this article: Deneen's point that what most people call today "conservative" and "liberal" are really just a slightly older and a slightly newer form of liberalism.  Make sure that you understand the difference between these two different forms of liberalism and why they both count as a form of liberalism.

Notice that market-based free enterprise is a feature of the old liberalism.  Why is this?   
[Page 5](sk://deneen12#5)

> Today's political debates occur largely and almost exclusively between liberals, first-wave and second-wave, neither of whom confront the fundamentally alternative understanding of human nature and the human relationship to nature that the preliberal tradition defended.   
[Page 6](sk://deneen12#6)

Make sure that you carefully understand the alternative preliberal conception of liberty outlined on this page and the difference with the liberal conception.  This will come back again at the end of the semester when we read Isaiah Berlin.

> Contemporary "conservatism" does not offer an answer to
> liberalism, because it is itself a species of liberalism.
