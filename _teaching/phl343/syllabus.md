## Course Description and Learning Outcomes ##

What is justice? What is the purpose of the state? How far should the state's power extent? Are there such things as universal human rights? What is political freedom, and how is it best secured? In this course, we will be asking---and hopefully beginning to answer---questions like these. While all these questions have practical implications because they concern our political and social life together, they are primarily of a theoretical or conceptual nature. As such, we will employ the tools of philosophical dialectic and argumentation in an effort to articulate answers to these questions in a rigorous way.

This effort will take place in three stages. First, you will engage primary texts in the history of political thought from Plato to J. S. Mill. This will give you a working knowledge of the major figures and concepts in the Western political tradition. Second, you will spend class time in dialog. This discussion will aim at evaluating whether the claims made by our authors are true or false and whether their arguments are sound or unsound. Third, you will learn to articulate your own position by way of written argument. This will help you bring clarity and precision to your thought.


The expected learning outcomes for this course are:
- to learn an appreciation for major philosophers'
  contributions to the Western philosophical tradition;
- to understand the primary questions, terminology, and
  theories in social and political philosophy;
- to learn to carefully read philosophical texts with a
  critical eye;
- to gain the capacity to communicate difficult
  philosophical thoughts in clear, concise prose; and
- to connect political thought with one's own faith.


## Grading ##

----------------- ----
Discussion        30% 
Reading Quizzes   20% 
Midterm Paper     25% 
Final Paper       25% 
----------------- ----


The largest portion of your grade will come from in-class discussion which I will evaluate on the basis of pluses, checks, and minuses recorded on your attendance card (see attendance section below). At the end of every class I run through all the students and award these marks, so you have a chance to improve your discussion grade each class period. I award a plus to students who make stand-out philosophical contributions to the class discussion during that period, and a check to students who participate at least once in a meaningful way. I rarely record minuses, but these are reserved for positively disruptive behavior. Four times evenly spaced through the semester I will enter a numerical discussion grade in Discovery. You are always welcome to see your card or talk to me so that you may know how well you are doing.

The next portion of your grade will come from regular (short) reading quizzes. These will be completed on Discovery and will typically consist of a few multiple-choice questions on the reading for the day. These quizzes are due before class on the day when the corresponding reading assignment is due. There is a time limit on these quizzes and they can only be taken once, so it is advisable that you complete them just as soon as you complete your reading. You will not have enough time to search the reading for the answers if you have not read it, but you may keep the reading assignment open to aid in the completion of the quiz. You will quickly find that you really must do the reading and do it quite carefully to do well on these quizzes.

At the middle and end of the semester, you will submit a short (1500--2000 words) paper on Discovery reflecting on any topic we have covered in class. I will provide further guidance on this paper as the due date approaches.

**Grading Scale:**

(I round all values to the nearest whole percent.)

A   100--90% 
B   89--80%  
C   79--70%  
D   69--60%  
E   59--0%

## Attendance ##

Although attendance does not compose its own segment of the grade, it is mandatory and failure to attend class will adversely impact your grade. Role will be taken at the beginning of every class period. Perfect attendance will result in an extra credit of +2 percentage points. The first 2 unexcused absences will not count against you, but beginning with the 3rd absence, each absence will subtract 2 percentage points from your final grade. This goes to a **limit of 7 unexcused absences** at which point you can no longer pass the class. For your reference:

Number of Absences  Percentage Change to Final Grade 
------------------- ---------------------------------
0                   $+2$
1                   0
2                   0
3                   $-2$
4                   $-4$
5                   $-6$
6                   $-8$
7                   $-50$




I keep track of absences by calling roll at the beginning of each class using a stack of index cards. If you do not respond when I call your name (perhaps because you are not there) you will be marked as absent. This means that if you walk in late it is your responsibility to check in with me each and every time. Lateness, especially if egregious or repeated, may be counted as an absence for the day. You are always welcome to look at your card and I encourage you to do so because it is your responsibility to keep track of how many absences I have recorded. This is especially important for students who are in danger of failing the class because of absences. I probably will not notice when you have six absences so I am unlikely to notify you when you are in danger of failing. Students missing class or an exam due to an excused absence bear the responsibility of informing me about their absence within one week following the period of the absence (except where prior notification is required) and providing appropriate documentation for the absence. Excused absences are not taken into account in the above adjustment to the final grade. It is entirely the student's responsibility to make up missed work. Make up work (including exams) must be submitted within one week of return to class. If you miss an exam due to an unexcused absence, you will receive a grade of zero for that exam. In general, I do not excuse on-line assignments.


## E-mail and Internet ##

You are expected to have an active e-mail account that you check regularly. Section related announcements will be made via e-mail (e.g. if I am sick, pointers for home work, change in due dates). Also, e-mail is the best way for contacting me outside of class.

You are expected to have access to a stable internet connection as reading quizzes are carried out on Discovery.



## Respectful Behavior ##

Mature, respectful behavior is expected in class. The primary concern is that all students are able to enjoy a focused, helpful classroom. This means that I expect you will among other things: arrive to class on time, stay awake, refrain from taking cell phone calls, playing games, or doing work for other classes. I will warn you once during a semester if a particular behavior is disruptive. If this behavior happens again, I may ask you to leave resulting in an absence for the day.

Class time is primarily focused on discussion of the material for which I expect you to be fully engaged. For this reason, I prohibit the use of electronic devices in class.


## Academic Integrity ##

Cheating robs other students of a fair grade. If it is determined that a student has cheated, all students involved will receive a grade of zero for the assignment. If the case is egregious, I will direct the case to the appropriate university dean for official sanction.
