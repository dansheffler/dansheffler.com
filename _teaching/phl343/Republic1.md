### Plato - *Republic* I ###

Socrates is being compelled by the force of a larger group to even have this conversation in the first place.  What is being said about compulsion, mob rule, and the practice of thinking here?
(327--328)

Notice that earning versus inheriting wealth is explicitly brought up.
(330a)

Notice how "what is fitting for each" turns into "good to friends and harm to enemies" without much reflection on Polemachus's part.
(332)

Notice how Socrates is encouraging Polemachus to treat justice like an art or a science.
(332e--333)

Notice also in this section the assumption that justice should be *useful for* something---something other than itself.

Notice the difference between seeming to be a friend and really being one.  People can be mistaken about their own interests and their own interest group.  This has implications for democracy.
(334)

Just as individuals can be mistaken about who their real friends are, rulers can be mistaken about which laws will be to their advantage.  Fallibility about what is good *for us* is being strongly thematized here.
(339)

Does Thrasymachus's shepherd analogy work for him or against him?

> Every kind of rule, insofar as it is rule, considers what is
> best for nothing other than for what is what is ruled and cared
> for, both in political and private rule.
> (345d)

Notice the principle here that even among a band of robbers there is a need for justice in order to function as a group.  This means that successful injustice is  parasitic upon justice.
(351c)
