## Berlin - "Two Concepts of Liberty" ##

Since freedom is such a foundation concept in political philosophy it is crucial to have a clear understanding of it. The first question we must ask in our analysis is "freedom from *what*?"   
[Page 15](sk://berlin84#1)

Two senses of freedom are positive and negative. The negative sense answers the question "What is the area in which I am left alone?" The positive sense answers the question, "What is the source of control that determines me to *this* rather than *that*?"   
[Page 15](sk://berlin84#1)

Unfreedom as *obstruction*.   
[Page 16](sk://berlin84#2)

Not just any obstruction, though. I am not *coerced* just because I am obstructed from flying. Coercion implies *deliberate* obstruction.   
[Page 16](sk://berlin84#2)

Poverty is only "economic enslavement" if *other people* are somehow behind my poverty.   
[Page 16](sk://berlin84#2)

Origin of the idea of rights: a minimum area of negative freedom that *cannot* be violated.   
[Page 17](sk://berlin84#3)

Very interesting: a connection here between the notion of *rights* and a sharp "frontier" being drawn between the public and the private sphere. Sharp segregation   
[Page 17](sk://berlin84#3)

Despite what people say at times, freedom is not the only political good and we often need to curtail freedom in order to secure these other goals. // We should wonder, however, about the nature of this competition. Is the resolution a principled one? Is there a unifying good to which the other goods can be reduced or is there some rational means by which we can play some other political goal off against freedom? Cf. the problems involved with commensurability from Nussbaum's comments in: [@sherman99 [page 147](sk://sherman99#167)]   
[Page 17](sk://berlin84#3)

This freedom is universal to all, not particular to a situation.   
[Page 18](sk://berlin84#4)

He needs a strong incommensurability thesis to maintain this.   
[Page 18](sk://berlin84#4)

Where do we draw the line around the minimum private area of non-interference? "That which man cannot give up without offending against the essence of his human nature." We can debate about exactly what human nature is and what list of individual rights is appropriate to it, but negative freedom and its associated rights *must* be based on a substantive view of human nature and essence.   
[Page 19](sk://berlin84#5)

Conception of human nature as "a being with a life of his own to live." This individualistic formulation is the wellspring and impetus of the negative version.   
[Page 20](sk://berlin84#6)

Two assumptions in Mill:

(i) Coercion is bad *as such*, but sometimes necessary to prevent worse evils. Non-interference is good *as such*, but there are other goods.

(ii) A certain kind of human character is desirable ("critical, original, imaginative, independent, non-conforming to the point of eccentricity, and so on") and negative freedom is a condition in which such a character thrives.

But what is the connection between these two claims. They are quite distinct and at best empirically united. As a matter of historical fact, the character endorsed by (ii) often flourishes under disciplined societies that fail to recognize (i).   
[Page 21](sk://berlin84#7)

Negative freedom is entirely consistent with an autocratic form of government so long as the despot largely leaves his subjects alone.   
[Page 22](sk://berlin84#8)

Logical distinction between the question "Who governs me?" and "How far does government interfere with me?"   
[Page 22](sk://berlin84#8)

Positive sense of liberty derives from the desire to be "one's own master".   
[Page 22](sk://berlin84#8)

This positive sense opens up the possibility of being "enslaved" by something other than political control. In this sense I can be enslaved by my passions, or by nature.   
[Page 23](sk://berlin84#9)

Being the instrument of my own *acts of will* is connected with me being a subject, an agent, a doer, and a *somebody*. // My *personhood* is deeply connected with my ability to *act*.

This is connected with a teleological conception of action. "Playing a human role" means "conceiving goals and policies of my own and realizing them."

There is also a connection with being "rational." Part of what it means to be a rational being is to act *for reasons*. For this to be the case, I must be free in the sense that *my* reasons are at least part of what determines my action not some external force, even if it is the reason of someone else or even Reason itself.

From this we get a rich notion of personal responsibility. If *I* am the source of my action and I can explain that action by reference to *my* reasons, then *I* must take responsibility for that action. I must bear it because there is no external origin.   
[Page 23](sk://berlin84#9)

It is possible once we have distinguished the "real self" from the individual *simpliciter* to identify this real self with something *larger* than the individual person, society as a whole, for instance. This move is extremely dangerous.   
[Page 24](sk://berlin84#10)

Another danger is that we can justify certain invasions of the minimal zone of negative freedom by claiming that this is what the individual *would* want if they were enlightened, uncorrupt etc.   
[Page 24](sk://berlin84#10)

This is a huge problem with much Kantian thinking and politics that follows from it (also Cf. Hare's idealized-self version of utilitarianism). It is a logical mistake to infer from "X is good for Y" to "Y has chosen X" (even though Y may not know it).   
[Page 24](sk://berlin84#10)

The sovereign Will of society for Rousseau knows no limits because he is concerned with a purely positive version of liberty.   
[Page 26](sk://berlin84#12)

The primary issue for defenders of individual liberty is not who wields the oppressive power, but rather *that the power wielded is oppressive*.

[Page 27](sk://berlin84#13)

Oppression is not solved by distributing the oppression equally or by elliciting some kind of consent.   
[Page 27](sk://berlin84#13)

Two core principles of the liberal tradition:

(i) Only *rights* are absolute never power. Every human has the absolute right to *refuse to behave inhumanly*.
(ii) There are certain inviolable frontiers beyond which lie the inhuman and the insane.   
[Page 28](sk://berlin84#14)

Belief in a "final solution" is the single greatest cause for the sacrifice of individuals on the altars of ideals.   
[Page 29](sk://berlin84#15)

We have this great hope that all our goods really are commensurable despite appearances because if this were not so the universe would not be a κόσμος.   
[Page 30](sk://berlin84#16)

Many goods are "equally ultimate" and "equally absolute." A strong incompatibility thesis.   
[Page 30](sk://berlin84#16)

Because we are in a situation which necessitates the choice between incomensurable goods, we *must* protect this freedom to choose. This inescapable condition makes such freedom an end in itself and not merely a temporary remedy.   
[Page 31](sk://berlin84#17)

The value pluralist must recognize, however, that the satisfaction and appeal of value monism is extremely strong.   
[Page 32](sk://berlin84#18)

Value pluralism is thus linked to negative liberty (because this liberty protects the ability to choose amongst the available, but incompatible goods), while value monism and the belief in a "final solution" leans toward positive liberty (because such liberty protects the ability of the individual to achieve this one 'true' end). The former is associated with lax states in which individuals are free to pursue their own ends even when these ends are less than ideal. The latter is associated with authoritarian and discipline oriented states in which an attempt is made to bring all the individuals in a society together into some kind of harmony. // The former is perhaps represented by Athens while the latter is represented by Sparta.

Berlin's argument seems to be that because the latter's goal is *impossible* the only thing left is to pursue the former conception of life. It seems to me, however, that he has a stronger option available to him. Because individual freedom of choice is constitutive of the human good. Even the believer of a "final solution" could maintain that such a solution *must* include the individual's freedom to choose his own path. Thus, negative freedom is protected *because* it is a *part of* the goal pursued by positive freedom.   
[Page 33](sk://berlin84#19)

Individual "negative" liberty is something men have found "indispensable to their life as unpredictably self-transforming human beings."[@berlin84 [33](sk://berlin84#18)]  This phrase tells us something important about Berlin's conception of the human person that is informing his political thinking.  He does not think that human nature is something fixed or even predictable.  The fight for positive freedom or a "final solution" is dangerous because they neglect the utterly unpredictable and heterogeneous nature of human pursuits.
   
[Page 33](sk://berlin84#19)

> Have not men had the experience of liberating themselves from spiritual slavery, or slavery to nature, and do they not in the course of it become aware, on the one hand, of a self which dominates, and, on the other, of something in them which is brought to heel?  This dominant self is then variously identified with reason, with my 'higher nature', with the self which calculates and aims at what will satisfy it in the long run, with my 'real', or 'ideal', or 'autonomous' self, or with my self 'at its best';  which is then contrasted with irrational impulse, uncontrolled desires, my 'lower' nature, the pursuit of immediate pleasures, my 'empirical' or 'heteronomous' self, swept by every gust of desire and passion, needing to be rigidly disciplined if it is ever to rise to the full height of its 'real' nature.

> This demonstrates (if demonstration of so obvious a truth is needed) that conceptions of freedom directly derive from views of what constitutes a self, a person, a man.
