Four types of government are (544c):

(1) Spartan (Timarchy)
(2) Oligarchy
(3) Democracy
(4) Tyranny



## Timarchy and Oligarchy ##

It is a metaphysical (rather than political) principle that *all* temporal objects must decline and decay. Hence, even the best of all governments will one day fall apart (546a).

The beginning of strife in the decay from the perfect city is conflict between those who value material things and those who value "true riches in their own hearts" (547b).

The timarchic individual sounds like a kind of tragic hero, having many good qualities, but this one tragic flaw: he is missing "a blend of reason and a properly trained imagination" (549b).

The oligarchy emerges as the love of money grows. Love of virtue and love of money cannot coexist (550e). "No man can serve two masters..."

The further problem with oligarchy is that once money become correlate with political power the rich and the poor become inevitable political enemies and so the state is split (551d).

The worst feature however is that the "indigent poor" emerge as a class with *no function* (552a). This is also true of the rich consumer of goods.

The oligarchy also introduces crime into society because of a "lack of education, bad upbringing and a bad form of government" (552e).

The oligarchic man elevates the element of *desire* to the place of rule in his soul (553c).

It turns out that the man who only had a reputation for justice because he feared the consequences is precisely this oligarchic character (554d).



## Democracy and Tyranny ##

Notice that, for Socrates, democracy is not really rule by the people because it originates as rule by the *poor* (557a).

Freedom is a long way from the rule of reason. It leads to the greatest variety of individual lives and leads to people living in whatever way pleases them rather than whatever way is best (557b).  Connect this with what we read in "Unsustainable Liberalism": when we have a society where people live according to whatever they individually want to do we give up people living according to the rule of universal obligations.

Democracy is "an agreeable anarchic form of society, with plenty of variety, which treats all men as equal, whether they are equal or not" (558c).

It is interesting that tyranny arises out of democracy rather than oligarchy as we might think (562b).

The freedom involved in democracy undermines authority, including that of the family (562e).

Notice how disdainful Socrates is of "complete" equality of the sexes in democracy (563b). This should stand in tension with what he claims about equality of the sexes among the guardians. So which is it?

Democracy devolves into mob rule which in turn becomes tyranny once a demagogue comes to the fore and steers the mob where he wishes (565e). We might think particularly on the aftermath of the French Revolution.

Poverty causes people to pay attention only to how to get their next meal rather than how to overthrow a dictator. Revolution requires leisure (567a).

All tyranny is parricide (569b).
