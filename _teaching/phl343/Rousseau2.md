## Rousseau Part II ##



"The first man who, having enclosed a piece of land, thought of saying 'This is mine' and found people simple enough to believe him, was the true founder of civil society" (109).

The origin of pride is first pride in the *species* which only later develops into pride in the *individual* (110).

In order to act toward other humans with a prudential self-interest, it is necessary to first observe that they are like oneself and are likely to think and be motivated like oneself (111).

Once a new thing becomes ingrained in our habits it stops being a pleasure. At this point, the *loss* of it, however, becomes a pain (113). Without this crucial step it is impossible for one man to gain power over another. There must be something that one can use as a *threat*.

The beginning of inequality is that man started to *care* what other people thought about him. People began to have regard for things like strength, beauty, eloquence. This introduces both pride and envy into the makeup of the human race (114).

Contrary to what we might expect, Rousseau thinks that this middle state between the absolute state of nature and full civil society was the "best for man" (115).

Metallurgy and agriculture extend the projects of man beyond what just one individual can accomplish. It is with them, that slavery comes about (116).

Justice only comes into play once men have divided land among themselves (117--118).

"The human race, debased and desolate, could not now retrace its path nor renounce the unfortunate acquisitions it had made, but laboring only towards its shame by misusing those faculties which should be its honour, brought itself to the brink of ruin" (120).

The institutions of law, justice, and government are introduced by the rich to protect what they now have against the use of violence by the multiplied poor (121).

Once enslaves man looses the taste for freedom (125).

One's freedom is not something one can legitimately contract away. It is *inalienable* (127--128).

Legitimate government is not the arbitrary power of the ruler, but the power of law legitimated by the corporate *will* of the people (128--129).

The very nature of such a social contract means that it cannot be irrevocable (129).

We ought to adopt religion because it gives a stability to governments that reason alone cannot (130).

Progression: (1) rich and poor (2) strong and weak (3) master and slave (131).
