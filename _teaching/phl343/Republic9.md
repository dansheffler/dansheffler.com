## Final Response to the Challenges of Books I and II ##

Law in the state corresponds to reason in the soul as the limiting and restraining element that keeps desires from going wild (571b).

Some of the strongest of our desires we share with the beasts, and are therefore less than fully human (572b).

Tyrannic desires, by their nature, have no limit, but our resources do. The man who is governed by such  ever increasing desires will therefore become a thief and will look around for someone to exploit (573e).

What begins as a kind of freedom (giving free reign to various desires in the democratic character) turns into a condition of total servitude (577d).

Contrary to the Thrasymachus's contentions in Book I, the tyrannic man is *most* unhappy.

Finally we come to the point that Socrates can answer both Thrasymachus's challenge and the deeper challenges posed by Glaucon and Adeimantus. The just man is ultimately happy, not because of some external reward but because of the inner nature of his soul while the tyrannic man is most wretched because he is a slave to his own passions (580c).

Notice that the soul is not broken down into the rational part and the part with desires (both spirited and appetitive), as though reason is opposed to desire and all desire is irrational. Instead, Socrates claims that there are different *kinds* of desires which are proper to the different parts (581c).

The pleasures of the rational life are indeed more pleasurable than those of the irrational because they are *truer* and therefore *more real* (586d).

These then become the pleasures that are most properly *human* (587b).

Socrates hints that we should perhaps rather call this element in us *divine* (589d).

The city that they have founded in speech (λόγος) will never exist in reality but we philosophers can "found it in our own heart." We can live by the principles of a just society even if it doesn't exist (592b).
