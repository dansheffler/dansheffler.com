## First Principles ##


**Basic Principle**: Every association (including the state) is formed "with a view to some good purpose" (1252a).

The state for Aristotle is defined as that association which encompasses all the others, the "ultimate" association (1252a).

Even at a basic biological level we *need one another*, as our being male and female attest. Each individual owes his very origin to the coming together or association of two others. We don't *choose* to be like this, it is simply a part of our nature (1252a).

The basic association is the household which Aristotle describes as an "association of persons, established according to nature for the satisfaction of daily needs." This association consists of three elements: (1) the men who rule (2) the men who are slaves and do the grunt work (3) the women who do the house-work and produce children. We should perhaps look past the unapologetic racism and sexism of this passage and understand the basic philosophical point Aristotle is after: that societies form because we need one another to preform different functions if even our basic needs as humans are to be satisfied (1252b).

**Basic Principle**: The process of association moves through the combination of households into villages to the final stage of the state. This process *starts* in order to secure just the basic necessities of life, but the state aims at something higher, securing a *good life* (1252b).

**Basic Principle**: Because this increasing process of association is implied by our natural constitution as individuals, the state is natural and man is a political animal, that is an animal that belongs in the state *by nature* (1253a).

Being a political animal is distinct from being a herd animal. Man alone possesses speech, which is used to *communicate* our awareness of good and evil. By forming an association on the basis of such communication our grouping together is different in kind from a swarm of bees (1253a).

The whole is prior to the part (1253a). Notice that this is *radically* different the modern liberal view.

Although material possessions do not *constitute* the good life, they do make it possible (1253b).


## Ruler--Ruled ##

The ruler--ruled relationship in its healthy form is expedient for both parties according to nature. This kind of relationship can be seen even in the individual where the rule of the soul over the body is not just good for the soul or for the individual as a whole, but actually benefits the health of the body too (1254b).

Unfortunately this does not always play out and there are many who are slaves who should not be slaves 'by nature' (1255a--b).

There is a basic distinction between the rule of the king and the rule of a statesmen. The rule of the king is properly that of the naturally free over the naturally ruled, whereas the rule of the statesmen is the rule of free among free (1255b).


## Property ##

Nature makes nothing with no purpose, and all of those things below man must be for his service (1256b).

There is a distinction between natural and unnatural acquisition of property. The former contains within itself a natural limit, whereas the later does not (1256b).

Bartering is a natural form of exchange because it keeps to nature's original purpose of establishing an equilibrium of goods (1257a).

Wealth in the form of money, however, has no natural limit and is adopted merely by convention. It is possible to have a heap of gold coin and yet not be able to eat. What sort of wealth is that? (1257b)

Further, wealth in the form of coin is not *productive* since it doesn't make anything new. It is only useful for the *exchange* of things already produced (1257b).


## Women and Children ##


The rule of the statesmen involves an *interchange* of ruler with ruled in order "to preserve natural equality and non-differentiation" (1259a).

Women and children like slaves are human and so partake in reason. Why then are they not fit to be the rulers (1259b)?

Virtue too is present (or should be) in both ruler and ruled. So this cannot be the basis of the distinction (1259b).

Aristotle's answer: True that reason and virtue are present in all, but their *distribution* is different. The virtues that are proper to a slave are different in kind than those proper to a child or a women or a man, likewise the *manner* in which they possess reason (1260a).

The virtue that is proper to each part has to do with its relation to the whole and the virtue that is proper to the whole (1260b).
