### Plato - *Republic* IV ###

The purpose in founding the state was not to promote the happiness of a single class but of the *whole community*.  Notice that happiness now becomes a feature of the society as a whole rather than of an individual alone. It is this flourishing of the whole community that is the target of Socrates's politics.
(420b)

Ruling is the "job" in the city that matters most of all; if it doesn't go well, the city is ruined.
(421a)

Both extremes of wealth and poverty inhibit people preforming their proper job well.
(421d)

Normal cities that we are used to are not really "cities" at all because they contain within them factions based on class.  Because of this they are at variance with themselves and do not form a single unity.  This multiplicity along the fault-lines of class can be exploited by the city's enemies by playing one class off against another.
(423a)

This sets up another fundamental principle of Socrates's government: The limit of growth for a city is "that point in its growth at which it's willing to be one" (423b).  A truly remarkable development in modern politics is the way we have invented devices for allowing this expansion to go on *ad infinitum*.

Education is one of the most important things in which a society can invest because its effects are cumulative from generation to generation.
(424a)

One of the great problems with a democratic form of government is that people tend to like the leaders that flatter them and confirm them in their current constitution.
(426c)

It is completely useless to try to legislate outward problems that are only symptomatic of the deeper ills of a society (426e).  The reason education is a first priority (cf. 424), is that it alone can change *who we are* rather than just coerce certain changes in *what we do*.

Justice becomes then the precondition for all the other good features of the state (433c).  At this point, Socrates claims that this is the principle of each person focusing on his proper function and preforming it with excellence.

> The having and doing of one's own and what belongs to oneself
> would be agreed to be justice.
> (434a)

Principle of similarity: justice will have to be the same one thing in the just individual and in the just city.
(435b)

We can identify a distinction between the reflective and the appetitive parts of the soul because it is possible for them to be in conflict. One wants a thing while the other simultaneously does not want it (439d). If we are going to think about the rational organization of the individual or of the city under justice we must think carefully about how to resolve these conflicts of interest between parts.

Justice in the individual soul is when each part preforms well its proper function.
(441e)

This very harmony of all the parts of the soul under the dictates of reason will cause the man to do all the external acts normally associated with justice, but these acts are symptoms of justice in the soul rather than constituents.
(433a)

When all these elements of the soul are brought into harmony this is *integrative*. This kind of life becomes fully "one instead of many" (433e). By contrast we may think of the unjust man as a kind of schizophrenic. With the parts of his soul at war with each other, his life becomes fractured and piecemeal.
