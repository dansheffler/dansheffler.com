## Course Description and Learning Outcomes ##

What does it mean to say that something is "real"? What is "reality"? What does the universe contain? Is there any reality that transcends the universe? Can we know any of this? If so, how? What does it mean to say that a statement is "true"? Does this mean that there is something called "the truth"? Can we know the truth? How? When we say that something is "good" what does this mean? Is it merely a subjective opinion, or does it rest on something real?

All these questions concern the nature of reality, our knowledge of it, and value. That is to say, these are the basic questions of *metaphysics*, *epistemology*, and *ethics*. The Christian cannot remain neutral on these questions because he is committed to the claim that Jesus of Nazareth is the very *Logos* of God.

In this course we will learn to evaluate such questions by using general philosophical principles and theories, but always with a view to the impact of a specifically Christian worldview. A running theme of this course will be the attempt to bring the claim of John 1:1 to bear on historical and contemporary philosophy as we unpack the claim itself.

You will first learn the relevant theoretical principles by studying primary source texts from ancient Greek, early modern, and contemporary philosophy. You will then learn how to bring these historical theories into dialog with Christian thought. Finally, you will be able to articulate your own position by written argument and in-class discussion.

The expected learning outcomes for this course are:

- To learn an appreciation for the tradition of philosophy and an
  ability to interact with its scholarship.
- To understand the primary questions, terminology, and theories of
  metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.
- To learn to read, understand, and interact with primary source
  philosophical texts (both historical and contemporary).
- To gain the capacity to communicate difficult philosophical thoughts
  in clear, concise prose.
- To connect the philosophical tradition with Christian faith.


## Grading ##

----------------- ----
Discussion        30% 
Reading Quizzes   20% 
Final Paper       20% 
Midterm Exam      15% 
Final Exam        15% 
----------------- ----


The largest portion of your grade will come from in-class discussion which I will evaluate on the basis of pluses, checks, and minuses recorded on your attendance card (see attendance section below). At the end of every class I run through all the students and award these marks, so you have a chance to improve your discussion grade each class period. I award a plus to students who make stand-out philosophical contributions to the class discussion during that period, and a check to students who participate at least once in a meaningful way. I rarely record minuses, but these are reserved for positively disruptive behavior. Four times evenly spaced through the semester I will enter a numerical discussion grade in Discovery. You are always welcome to see your card or talk to me so that you may know how well you are doing.

The next portion of your grade will come from regular (short) reading quizzes. These will be completed on Discovery and will typically consist of a few multiple-choice questions on the reading for the day. These quizzes are due before class on the day when the corresponding reading assignment is due. There is a time limit on these quizzes and they can only be taken once, so it is advisable that you complete them just as soon as you complete your reading. You will not have enough time to search the reading for the answers, but you may keep the reading assignment open to aid in the completion of the quiz.

At the end of the semester, you will submit a short (1500--2000 words) paper on Discovery reflecting on any topic we have covered in class. I will provide further guidance on this paper as the due date approaches. The midterm and the final will both comprise 15% of your grade and will mainly consist of factually oriented multiple choice questions concerning the reading (hint: it is a good idea to review past reading quizzes), but there will also be a handful of reflective short-answer questions.

**Grading Scale:**

E   59--0%

## Attendance ##

Although attendance does not compose its own segment of the grade, it is mandatory and failure to attend class will adversely impact your grade. Role will be taken at the beginning of every class period. Perfect attendance will result in an extra credit of +2 percentage points. The first 2 unexcused absences will not count against you, but beginning with the 3rd absence, each absence will subtract 2 percentage points from your final grade. This goes to a **limit of 7 unexcused absences** at which point you can no longer pass the class. For your reference:

Number of Absences  Percentage Change to Final Grade 
------------------- ---------------------------------
0                   $+2$
1                   0
2                   0
3                   $-2$
4                   $-4$
5                   $-6$
6                   $-8$
7                   $-50$


Tardiness, especially if egregious or repeated, may be counted as an absence for the day.

I keep track of absences by calling roll at the beginning of each class using a stack of index cards (or my iPad). You are always welcome to look at your card and I encourage you to do so because it is your responsibility to keep track of how many absences I have recorded. This is especially important for students who are in danger of failing the class because of absences. I probably will not notice when you have six absences so I am unlikely to notify you when you are in danger of failing. Students missing class or an exam due to an excused absence bear the responsibility of informing me about their absence within one week following the period of the absence (except where prior notification is required) and providing appropriate documentation for the absence. Excused absences are not taken into account in the above adjustment to the final grade. It is entirely the student's responsibility to make up missed work. Make up work (including exams) must be submitted within one week of return to class. If you miss an exam due to an unexcused absence, you will receive a grade of zero for that exam. In general, I do not excuse on-line assignments.


## E-mail ##

You are expected to have an active e-mail account that you check regularly. Section related announcements will be made via e-mail (e.g. if I am sick, pointers for home work, change in due dates). Also, e-mail is the best way for contacting me outside of class.


## Respectful Behavior ##

Mature, respectful behavior is expected in class. The primary concern is that all students are able to enjoy a focused, helpful classroom. This means that I expect you will among other things: arrive to class on time, stay awake, refrain from taking cell phone calls, playing games, or doing work for other classes. I will warn you once during a semester if a particular behavior is disruptive. If this behavior happens again, I may ask you to leave resulting in an absence for the day.

Class time is primarily focused on discussion of the material for which I expect you to be fully engaged. For this reason, I prohibit the use of electronic devices in class.


## Academic Integrity ##

Cheating robs other students of a fair grade. If it is determined that a student has cheated, all students involved will receive a grade of zero for the assignment. If the case is egregious, I will direct the case to the appropriate University Dean for official sanction.
