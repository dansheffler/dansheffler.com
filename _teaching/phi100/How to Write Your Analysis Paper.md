## How to Write Your Analysis Paper ##


Every couple chapters you will need to write an analysis paper on two of the secondary readings that you will find listed in the "For Further Reading" section at the end of each chapter.  You can pick any readings that you like from the appropriate chapters, and you may ask me for permission to do other readings that are not listed (I am usually fine with it as long as it is relevant and rigorous).  You will need to identify two authors that have a clear disagreement about a specific philosophical issue related to the chapters we have read.  Part of the assignment involves learning to do your own research, to use the library's resources, and to think for yourself.  This means that you may need to look up and begin to read more than two sources in order to find suitable material.  Once you have picked what you want, here are the steps to writing an A paper:

1. **Read**. Make sure that you actually read what your authors
   have to say.  Reading real philosophy is hard; do not expect
   this to take 20 minutes.  You will need to read most paragraphs
   at least twice before you understand them, usually more.  When I
   read philosophy, I usually budget about one hour for every ten
   pages.  Make sure that you take notes on the flow of the
   argument.  Identify specific truth claims in the text and which
   logical moves are being made to support them.  Diagramming the
   argument often helps.
2. **Identify Theses**.  Try to catch your authors red handed.  By
   this I mean that you should find places where they make explicit
   claims.  Begin your paper with a direct, outright statement of
   what these authors claim---this must literally take place in the
   first sentences of your paper without any fluffy intro sentences
   or you will have points taken off. Here is a model sentence that
   you should use, replacing the pieces as necessary: "In 'What
   it's Like to be a Bat,' Thomas Nagel claims that consciousness
   cannot be explained by science, while Jaegwon Kim, in
   *Physicalism, or Something Near Enough*, claims that it can."
   Here are some examples of what does ***NOT*** count as a good
   first sentence: (i) "In 'What it's Like to be a Bat,' Thomas
   Nagel discusses the important idea of consciousness and Jaegwon
   Kim does too." (ii) "In 'What it's Like to be a Bat,' Thomas
   Nagel wonders what exactly it would take to explain
   consciousness, while Jaegwon Kim does not address this
   question." (iii) "I chose to write my paper about Nagle Toms
   book *What it would be like to be a bat*. I lovd it!1!"  A
   common mistake students make is identifying mere themes,
   questions, topics, or examples rather than definite claims.
3. **Identify Premises**.  Find at least three facts, that is
   definite truth claims, that your chosen authors use to support
   the claims that you have identified.  Ask yourself, "Does this
   author ever tell me explicitly why he believes X?"  Typically,
   mere examples of what he is talking about do not really count as
   supporting reasons.  Your task is not to outline.  In all
   likelihood your authors talk about a lot of things that do not
   directly support the thesis you have chosen. If you find
   yourself writing something like "he goes on to discuss" or "he
   backs up his statement with the example of..." you are probably
   "summarizing" rather than analyzing an argument.  If I catch
   you slipping into this "book-report mode" I will deduct five
   points. Instead, focus exclusively on specific claims that
   definitely support the thesis.  Write out these supporting
   claims in the clearest, most concise writing you can manage. You
   may identify two supporting points for one author and one for
   the other, but each author must have at least one piece of
   supporting evidence.  You may identify more than three points if
   you find them.
4. **Identify Logic**.  Work out for yourself the logical
   connection between the supporting points and the thesis.  Ask
   yourself what kind of evidence they offer for it and why.
   *Explain* this connection in definite sentences.  Once you have
   done this, you should easily have exceeded the 250 word count
   for the analysis section.
5. **Take a Stand**.  Figure out where *you* stand on the issue. Do
   you agree with one of the authors over the other?  Do you agree
   with neither?  Do you agree with one author but disagree with
   his reasoning? In the first sentence of your argumentative
   reflection section make a definite claim.  Here is an example:
   "While Thomas Nagel is correct to think that consciousness
   cannot be explained by science, he is incorrect to think that it
   cannot be explained at all."  Do ***NOT*** talk about whether
   you liked the reading, how good the author was, whether the
   examples were clear etc. Your job is to make a philosophical
   *argument* of your own rather than act as an art critic.  Do not
   narrate your personal reaction or thought process.  Instead,
   focus on an objective claim.  I call this "staying objective" in
   the rubric.  If you slip into subjective assessment of the
   authors' style you will loose five points.
6. **Craft an Argument**.  Think up at least three supporting
   pieces of evidence for why another rational human being should
   agree that the claim you just wrote in step 5 is the truth.  You
   don't have to *prove* beyond all doubt that your claim is the
   truth (there will always be *someone* who disagrees).  Instead
   you should strive to find pieces of evidence that are good
   enough that if a reasonable person were to accept your evidence
   they would be hard pressed not to draw the same conclusion as
   you.
7. **Clean Up**.  Give both the analysis section and the
   argumentative response section a label so that I can clearly see
   where one ends and the other begins.  Double check the names of
   authors and titles (seriously, people get this wrong all the
   time and it looks really bad).  Read the entire piece out loud
   to yourself and make sure that each of your sentences is
   grammatical and actually makes sense.  Replace any big or
   technical words that you yourself don't understand.  Double
   check things like placement of commas, possessive apostrophes,
   usage of contractions, passive voice, ambiguous pronouns etc.
   If you need help with this last bit, bring a draft of your paper
   to office hours and I will read it over with you.  You can also
   try the Writing Center.


Below you will find the rubric I use in grading these papers.  On some parts, you can get partial credit for what I judge to be a solid effort.  On the grammar part, I simply take one point off for every error I see to a limit of 20.
