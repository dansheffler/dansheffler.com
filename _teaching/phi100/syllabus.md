## Required Texts ##

- Nils Ch. Rauhut, *Ultimate Questions*, third edition (Prentice
  Hall, 2011), ISBN 02573197X.


## Course Description and Learning Outcomes ##

This course aims to provide you with a foundation in the basic questions, techniques, and concepts of philosophy.  We will take our point of departure from Nils Rauhut's survey, focusing each unit of the class on one of philosophy's classic "Ultimate Questions."  Everyone will go through this book to get the fundamentals, but you must also engage primary sources that you will select from the "For Further Reading" section of each chapter.  Reading comprehension and engagement will therefore be central to this class.  After you have learned to read and think about what important philosophers have to say on these big questions you must also learn to think about your own conclusions and articulate those conclusions in clear, persuasive writing.  Be prepared to *read*, to *think* about what you read, and to *write* about what you think.

## Grading ##

The first portion of your grade will come from regular (short) reading quizzes. These will be completed on Canvas and will typically consist of a few multiple-choice questions on the reading for the day. These quizzes are due before class on the day when the corresponding reading assignment is due. There is a time limit on these quizzes and they can only be taken once, so it is advisable that you complete them just as soon as you complete your reading. You will not have enough time to search the reading for the answers, but you may keep the reading assignment open to aid in the completion of the quiz.  I do not accept "my internet broke" excuses for resetting these quizzes (mysteriously there is always one student who can't figure out how to use the internet for the whole semester and they are also mysteriously the same student that has the lowest quiz grades).  In compensation, I drop the lowest quiz grade (because I understand that sometimes your internet really does break).  I recommend that you do not take these quizzes on your phone or at coffee shops with sketchy connections (Coffea).  This solves most problems.

At the end of each chapter, you will submit a short (500--1000 words) paper on Canvas reflecting on one of the readings in the "For Further Reading" section of each chapter.  If you select a book, you must read one chapter from this book.  If you select an article, you must read the whole article.  Spend at least 250 words of your paper analyzing the argument of the chapter or article.  Specifically, you should identify the main conclusion and the main premises that the author uses to support this conclusion.  Next, spend at least 250 words articulating your own response to this argument.  Do you agree with the conclusion or not?  Does the author do a good job supporting his conclusion with reasons or is there a problem?  Each of these papers is worth 5% of your grade for a total of 35% over the course of the semester.

The midterm and the final will each comprise 15% of your grade (for a total of 30%) and will mainly consist of factually oriented multiple choice questions concerning the reading (hint: it is a good idea to review past reading quizzes), but there will also be a handful of reflective short-answer questions.  You will take both midterm and final on line (do not come to class that day; you will be sad).

## E-mail and Internet ##

You are expected to have an active e-mail account that you check regularly. Section related announcements will be made via e-mail (e.g. if I am sick, pointers for home work, change in due dates). Also, e-mail is the best way for contacting me outside of class.

You are expected to have access to a stable internet connection as reading quizzes are carried out on Canvas.  I will not reset quizzes because of internet trouble (doing so is simply too easy to abuse and has been in the past).  Instead, I will be dropping the lowest reading quiz score for everyone.



## Respectful Behavior ##

Mature, respectful behavior is expected in class. The primary concern is that all students are able to enjoy a focused, helpful classroom. This means that I expect you will among other things: arrive to class on time, stay awake, refrain from taking cell phone calls, playing games, or doing work for other classes. I will warn you once during a semester if a particular behavior is disruptive. If this behavior happens again, I may ask you to leave resulting in an absence for the day.


## Disability Accommodation ##

If you have a documented disability that requires academic accommodations, please see me as soon as possible during scheduled office hours. In order to receive accommodations in this course, you must provide me with a Letter of Accommodation from the Disability Resource Center (Room 2, Alumni Gym, 257‚Äê2754, email address: jkarnes@email.uky.edu) for coordination of campus disability services available to students with disabilities. Accommodations cannot be made retroactively, so please provide me with a letter as early in the semester as possible.


## Academic Integrity ##

Cheating robs other students of a fair grade. If it is determined that a student has cheated, all students involved will receive a grade of zero for the assignment. If the case is egregious, I will direct the case to the appropriate University Dean for official sanction.
