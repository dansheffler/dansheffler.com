# Scriptural Support for the Idea that Love is a Gift of Self #

These scriptures must be prefaced with the observation that ψυχή here frequently means more than merely biological life, so that the phrase "give one's life" is not just a figure of speech for dying.  Instead, ψυχή represents one's whole self.  This comes out in the parallel verses where ἑαυτός is used instead.

> ...even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to
> give his life (δοῦναι τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ) as a ransom for many.
> (Matthew 20:28)

> I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life (τὴν
> ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ τίθησιν) for the sheep.
> (John 10:11)

> This is my commandment, that you love one another *as I have
> loved you*. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay
> down his life (τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ θῇ) for his friends.
> (John 15:12--13)

> I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live,
> but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh
> I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself
> (παραδόντος ἑαυτὸν) for me.
> (Galatians 2:20)

> Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children.  And walk in
> love, *as Christ loved* us and gave himself up (παρέδωκεν ἑαυτὸν)
> for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
> (Ephesians 5:1--2)

> By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us (ὑπὲρ
> ἡμῶν τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἔθηκεν), and we ought to lay down our lives
> for the brothers (ὀφείλομεν ὑπὲρ τῶν ἀδελφῶν τὰς ψυχὰς θεῖναι).
> (1 John 3:16)

> Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave
> himself up (ἑαυτὸν παρέδωκεν) for her...
> (Ephesians 5:25)

> Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus,a
> who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality
> with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking
> the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.  And
> being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming
> obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.  Therefore
> God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is
> above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should
> bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue
> confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
> Father.
> (Philippians 2:5--11)

> So, being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share
> with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves
> (μεταδοῦναι...καὶ τὰς ἑαυτῶν ψυχάς), because you had become very
> dear to us.
> (1 Thessalonians 2:8)


## The Great Paradox ##

> And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the
> word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto
> death (οὐκ ἠγάπησαν τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτῶν ἄχρι θανάτου).
> (Revelation 12:11)

> If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother
> and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his
> own life (ἔτι τε καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν ἑαυτοῦ), he cannot be my disciple.
> (Luke 14:26)

> Whoever loves his life (ὁ φιλῶν τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ) loses it, and
> whoever hates his life (ὁ μισῶν τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ) in this world
> will keep it for eternal life.
> (John 12:25)

> Whoever finds his life (ὁ εὑρὼν τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ) will lose it,
> and whoever loses his life (ὁ ἀπολέσας τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ) for my
> sake will find it.
> (Matthew 10:39)

> For whoever would save his life (ὃς...θέλῃ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ σῶσαι)
> will lose it, but whoever loses his life (ὃς...ἀπολέσῃ τὴν ψυχὴν
> αὐτοῦ) for my sake will find it.
> (Matthew 16:25; Mark 8:35; Luke 9:24; Luke 17:33)
