The word 'gospel' is a kingdom word.  People often say that it means "good news," and this is true, but it must be understood as good news of a particular sort.


## Proclamation ##

We see the meaning of the term come out at the beginning and ending of the Gospel of Matthew:

#### Matthew 4:23 ####
> And he went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their
> synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and
> healing every disease and every affliction among the
> people.

#### Matthew 24:14 ####
> And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed
> throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations,
> and then the end will come.

The gospel is good news, but it is the good news *of the kingdom coming*.  Notice also the word 'proclaim' in both these verses.  The gospel is not the sort of thing that one murmurs at a coffee shop.  One does not subtly hint at it between sermon jokes.  The gospel is a kingdom message that is to be declared loudly, accompanied with military trumpets.

The Greek word for proclaim in these passages is related to the word for herald.  In 490 BC, the Greeks won the battle of Marathon against an overwhelmingly large Persian army.  As part of this victory, the Athenian general Miltiades sent the professional herald Pheidippides as a runner to Sparta to ask for help.  Pheidippides ran the 150 miles to Sparta and back in less than two days.  Then, with the victory in hand, he ran another 26 miles to Athens to announce the victory before the cities inhabitants fled.  Arriving before the city archons, he proclaimed, "Joy! Victory!" collapsing at their feet in exhaustion, dying with this declaration on his lips.

This exemplifies the meaning of the word 'gospel' in Greek, because Pheidippides's message is the good news of a victorious army loudly declared.  The kingdom has arrived!  We are victorious!  Joy!  Death is beaten!


## The Kingdom is Upon You ##

In Matthew, the meaning of the proclamation carries with it a note of threat.  Consider what both Jesus and John proclaim as they travel about Judea proclaiming the gospel:

#### Matthew 3:2 ####
> "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."

#### Matthew 4:17 ####
> From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for
> the kingdom of heaven is at hand."

*Because* the kingdom is near---on your very doorstep---you need to repent now.  Jesus does not say, "You should repent because it will make your life more pleasant," or, "You should repent because it will assuage your guilty conscience."  No, the reason you should repent is that the army of God's kingdom has just showed up at your gates.  

This meaning shows up quite forcefully in one of Jesus's confrontations with the Pharisees:

#### Matthew 12:25--28 ####
> But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then
> the kingdom of God has come upon you."

Imagine Prince John from Robin Hood sitting all smugly in his castle counting his coins.  John only has any power at all because his brother, Richard the Lion Heart, has been away for years on the crusades.  The kingdom only exists as a unified whole because of Richard's personal strength as a ruler and the might of his armies.  With his brother gone, John can take advantage of his brother's strength in order to use the kingdom for his own ends.  But one day, a herald---a proclaimer of a message---arrives pounding violently on the big wooden doors at the end of John's great hall.  John is caught off guard because he did not even know that his brother was sailing for home, much less that he had already arrived.  Richard's herald proclaims through the keyhole, "Your time is up!  The *real* king has arrived!  Lay down your crown and scepter!"  Looking out the window, John sees Richard on his great grey warhorse with his banners and emblems streaming behind him.  At his back, rank upon rank of spears glitter in the sun.

Now ask yourself: How many times have you heard a gospel presentation with this character---the declaration of a king arriving with his kingdom?  Yet this is just what we find in the New Testament.  Lord send us boldness.
