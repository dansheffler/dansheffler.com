## The Baals ##

- Tounge-in-cheeck title: "How to Worship Demons"
- Meaning of the term "Baal"


#### Male Cult Prostitutes ####

- 1 Kings 14:24
- Forbidden in Deuteronomy 23:17
- Put away in 1 Kings 15:12

From Elicott's commentary:

> There is a horrible significance in the derivation of this word,
> which is properly "consecrated," or "devoted;" for it indicates
> the license, and even the sanction, of unnatural lusts in those
> consecrated to the abominations of Nature-worship. The appearance
> of such in the land, whether Canaanites or apostate Israelites,
> is evidently noted as the climax of the infinite corruption which
> had set in, rivalling—and, if rivalling, exceeding in depth of
> wickedness—the abominations of the old inhabitants of the land.
> That such horrors are not incompatible with advance in knowledge
> and material civilisation, history tells us but too plainly. To
> find them sanctioned under cover of religious ritual marks,
> however, a lower depth still.

From Benson's commentary:

> The kind of wickedness here referred to often attended idolatry,
> 1 Kings 15:12; 2 Kings 23:7; for among the heathen the most
> filthy things were practised in these shady, dark places, their
> groves: and such wickedness, it appears from the passages now
> quoted, existed at this time among the Israelites, who, out of
> devotion to some false god or other, prostituted their bodies,
> contrary to nature, to be abused in honour of those gods, in
> direct opposition to the law, Deuteronomy 23:17. They did
> according to all the abominations of the nations, &c. — They
> dishonoured God by the sin of idolatry, and therefore God left
> them to dishonour their own bodies in this abominable manner.

- 1 Kings 18:28, "And they cried aloud and *cut themselves after
  their custom* with swords and lances, until the blood gushed out
  upon them."
- 1 Kings 18:29, "And as midday passed, they *raved* on until the
  time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice.  No
  one answered; no one paid attention."


#### Child Sacrifice ####
