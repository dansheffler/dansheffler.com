There is an apparent tension between these two fact: (i) God is loving, and (ii) people go to hell.


In order to understand why God would allow people to go to hell, we need to begin a long way off and answer some fundamental questions about the world.  Only then will we be in a position to ask the hell question.  People like to dive in and grapple with the tough questions without first pouring an intellectual foundation and building the base brick by brick.  This is like trying to put a roof on a non-existent house.


## The Possibility of Relationship ##

A fairly standard theodicy goes like this: freedom is necessary for love, and freedom requires the very real possibility of going wrong.  Thus, if God wants to create creatures that love, he necessarily must allow those creatures the very real possibility of going wrong.  I think this line of thought is basically right, but I wish to expand it a little here.  The problem is not just that *love* is impossible without freedom, but that *any* kind of relationship is impossible without freedom---and freedom of a particular sort.

By 'relationship' I do not mean the same thing that logicians mean by 'relation.'  A predicate is a relation when it take two or more compliments.  Thus, *on top of* is a relation because it always takes two compliments: $X$ is *on top of* $Y$.  By contrast, *red* is not a relation because it only takes one compliment: $X$ is *red*.  Similarly, a relationship requires two or more, but the two "compliments" in a relationship cannot be any old thing.  Consider, for example, the kind of relationship we call "friendship."  I cannot say, "Andrew is friends with this concrete slab" (except perhaps metaphorically).  The entity on the right side of the relationship is of the wrong sort: concrete slabs don't relate.  But why not?  What does the concrete slab lack that Peter, say, possesses?  Andrew can actually *address* Peter, and Peter can *respond* to Andrew *out of himself*.  We might imagine Andrew in a crazy or wistful mood speaking to his concrete slab, but we would never understand this as a literal act of address, and no matter how crazy Andrew becomes, the slab will never respond out of itself.

Suppose, however, that we dress the concrete slab up a bit.  What if we gave that slab a fancy computer processor, a shiny screen displaying the image of a face, and some speakers?  Could fancy-slab now enter into a *relationship* with Andrew?  Andrew can now speak to fancy-slab and fancy-slab can make some voice-like noises back---perhaps so cleverly that it deceives even Andrew into thinking that he has a friendship with fancy-slab.  Nevertheless, Andrew's relationship with fancy-slab is merely illusory.  In all the interactions between Andrew and fancy-slab, the sounds and images coming from the slab's side do not proceed from the slab itself---they are not *acts* properly so called, but rather mere preprogrammed events.

Further, in order to enter into a relationship, an entity must posses more than a capacity for self-initiated action.  The participants in a relationship must also have the ability to conceive of the other participants *as relational participants*, and form intentions about how they will interact with them on this basis.  Consider Andrew, for instance, attempting to enter into friendship with a hypothetical entity, Solo, who is capable of spontaneous action, but cannot conceive of Andrew as the sort of being that could be a friend.  Andrew might act in a certain way toward Solo, and he might see some unpredictable behavior from Solo as a result, but Solo will not be treating *Andrew* in any particular way.  Solo's world is populated only with *things*.  From Solo's perspective, he is alone (if he can even form the concept of *alone*).  He sees this body-shaped hunk of matter behaving in curious ways, but he will not fundamentally treat this hunk of matter differently than the rocks and flowing streams he experiences.


- Can I come up with a list of "relationship words"?
- Many of the person-specific words I want to use have been coopted by computer science (e.g. 'communicate', 'respond'), and this is troublesome because I want to deny that computers are persons.



- Particular case of the problem of evil.
- Has to do with the sort of thing a *person* is.
- Nature of relationship
- Freedom
