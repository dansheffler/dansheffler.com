## Trinitarian Formulations in St. Justin Martyr ##

> Permit me, further, to show you from the book of Exodus how this
> same One, who is both Angel, and God, and Lord, and man, and who
> appeared in human form to Abraham and Isaac, appeared in a flame
> of fire from the bush and conversed with Moses.
> (*Dialogue with Trypho* LIX, ANF1.226b)

> ...So that even though it be as you say, that there were two---an
> angel and God---he who has but the smallest intelligence will not
> venture to assert that the Maker and Father of all things, having
> left all supercelestial matters, was visible on a little portion
> of the earth.
> (*Dialogue with Trypho* LX, ANF1.227a)

> "I shall give you another testimony, my friends," said I, "from
> the Scriptures, that God begat before all creatures a Beginning,
> [who was] a certain rational power [proceeding] from Himself (ὅτι
> ἀρχὴν πρὸ πάντων τῶν κτισμάτων ὁ Θεὸς γεγέννηκε δύναμίν τινα ἐξ
> ἑατοῦ λογικὴν), who is called by the Holy Spirit, now the Glory
> of the Lord, now the Son, again Wisdom, again an Angel, then God,
> and then Lord and Logos; and on another occasion he calls Himself
> Captain, when He appeared in human form to Joshua the son of Nave
> (Nun).  For he can be called by all those names, since He
> ministers to the Father's will, and since He was begotten of the
> Father by an act of will; just as we see happening among
> ourselves: for when we give out some word, we beget the word
> (λόγον γάρ τινα προθάλλοντες, λόγον γεννῶμεν); yet not by
> abscission, so as to lessen the word [which remains] in us, when
> we give it out (οὐ κατὰ ἀποτομὴν, ὡς ἐλαττωθῆναι τὸν ἐν ἡμῖν
> λόγον προθαλλόμενοι): and just as we see also happening in the
> case of a fire, which is not lessened when it has kindled
> [another], but remains the same; and that which has been kindled
> by it likewise appears to exist by itself, not diminishing that
> from which it was kindled.  The Word of Wisdom, who is
> Himself this God begotten of the Father of all things (αὐτὸς ὢν
> οὗτος ὁ Θεὸς ἀπὸ τοῦ Πατρὸς τῶν ὅλων γεννηθεὶς), and Word, and
> Wisdom, and Power, and the Glory of the Begetter, will bear
> evidence to me, when He speaks by Solomon the following...

> From which we can indisputably learn that [God] conversed with
> someone who was numerically distinct from Himself, and also a
> rational Being (ἐξ ὧν ἀναμφιλέκτως πρὸς τινὰ καὶ ἀριθμῷ ὄντα
> ἕτερον, λογικὸν ὑπάρχοντα, ὡμιληκέναι αὐτὸν ἐπιγνῶναι ἔχομεν).
> These are the words: "And God said, Behold, Adam has become as
> one of us, to know good and evil."  In saying, therefore, "as one
> of us," [Moses] has declared that [there is a certain] number of
> persons associated with one another, and that they are at least
> two (καὶ ἀριθμὸν τῶν ἀλλήλοις συνόντων, καὶ τὸ ἐλάχιστον δύο).
> For I would not say that the dogma of that heresy which is said
> to be among you is true or that the teachers of it can prove that
> [God] spoke to angels, or that the human frame was the
> workmanship of angels.  But this Offspring, which was truly
> brought forth from the Father, was with the Father before all the
> creatures, and the Father communed with Him (Ἀλλὰ τοῦτο τὸ τῷ
> ὄντι ἀπὸ τοῦ Πατρὸς προθληθὲν γέννημα, πρὸ πάντων τῶν ποιημάτων
> συνῆν τῷ Πατρὶ, καὶ τούτῳ ὁ Πατὴρ προσομιλεῖ); even as the
> Scripture by Solomon has made clear, that He whom Solomon calls
> Wisdom, was begotten as a Beginning before all His creatures and
> as Offspring by God.

> [When the scripture says things like "The Lord came down"] you
> must not imagine that the unbegotten God Himself (αὐτὸν τὸν
> ἀγέννητον Θεὸν) came down or went up from any place.  For the
> ineffable Father (ἄρρητος Πατὴρ) and Lord of all neither has come
> to any place, nor walks, nor sleeps, nor rises up, but remains in
> His own place, wherever that is, quick to behold and quick to
> hear, having neither eyes nor ears, but being of indescribable
> might....Therefore neither Abraham, nor Isaac, nor Jacob, nor any
> other man, saw the Father and ineffable Lord of all (τὸν Πατέρα
> καὶ ἄρρηρον Κύριον τῶν πάντων ἁπλῶς), and also of Christ, but
> [saw] Him who was according to His will His Son, being God (Θεὸν
> ὄντα Ὑιὸν), and the Angel because He ministered to His will; whom
> also it pleases Him to be born man by the Virgin; who also was
> fire when He conversed with Moses from the bush.
> (*Dialogue with Trypho* CXXVII, ANF1.263b)

> When the Scripture says, "the Lord rained fire from the Lord out
> of heaven," the prophetic word indicates that there were two in
> number (δύο ὄντας ἀριθμῷ): One upon the earth, who, it says,
> descended to behold the cry of Sodom; another in heaven, who also
> is Lord of the Lord on earth (ὅς καὶ τοῦ ἐπὶ γῆς Κυρίου Κύριός
> ἐστιν), as He is Father and God (ὡς Πατὴρ καὶ Θεὸς); the cause of
> His power and of His being Lord and God (αἰτιός τε αὐτῷ τοῦ εἶναι
> καὶ δυνατῷ, καὶ Κυρίῳ, καὶ Θεῷ).  Again, when the Scripture
> records that God said in the beginning, "Behold, Adam has become
> like one of Us," this phrase, "like one of Us," is also
> indicative of number; and the words do not admit of a figurative
> meaning....You perceive, my hearers, if you bestow attention,
> that the Scripture has declared that this Offspring was begotten
> by the Father before all things created (γεγεννῆσθαι ὑπὸ τοῦ
> Πατρὸς τοῦτο τὸ γέννημα πρὸ πάντων ἁπλῶς τῶν κτισμάτων); and that
> that which is begotten is numerically distinct from that which
> begets (καὶ τὸ γεννώμενον τοῦ γεννῶντος ἀριθμῷ ἕτερόν ἐστι), any
> one will admit.
