# The Theme of Work in Proverbs #

#### Proverbs 6:6--11 ####
> Go to the ant, O sluggard;\
> consider her ways, and be wise.\
> Without having any chief,\
> officer, or ruler,\
> she prepares her bread in summer\
> and gathers her food in harvest.\
> How long will you lie there, O sluggard?\
> When will you arise from your sleep?\
> A little sleep, a little slumber,\
> a little folding of the hands to rest,\
> and poverty will come upon you like a robber,\
> and want like an armed man.

It is so easy to say, "Just a little more..." but the question we must put to our sloth is, "How long?"  The ant works without needing to be externally pushed by a "chief, officer, or ruler."  The ant also works at an opportune time when the consequence is yet far off.  This is the opposite of putting heavy work off until the very last minute when ruin is at your doorstep.

> [The sluggard] sleeps over his work, and, if for a moment half-
> startled by some rousing call, still pleads for *a little more
> sleep, and folds his hands to sleep*.  Present ease is all he
> calculates on, all he provides for.  The future he carefully
> keeps out of sight, to be provided for, like the present, when it
> comes.  Thus life runs to waste.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

> Slight not the call of the present moment.  The spell grows
> stronger, as resistance is delayed.  Every day's slumber makes it
> more improbable, whether thou wilt ever awaken at all.  The
> intended struggle of to-morrow is a delusion.  A thousand such to-
> morrows there may be; and yet thou mayest be found at last
> perishing in they poverty, and the King of terror will come as an
> armed man to summon thee to judgment.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

I have noticed this in my own life.  When I give into sloth, a cloudy frame of mind takes over making it harder and harder to rouse myself out of further sloth.

> Always, therefore, look at sloth, not as an infirmity, but as a
> sin, affecting the whole man: growing upon us with unperceived
> power.  Allow it therefore no rest, no time to root itself.
> Resist it in all its forms---bodily, mental, spiritual:
> indulgence of sleep and appetite: self-pleasing in all its subtle
> and plausible workings.  Live by rule.  Have your time strictly
> arranged.  Be employed in early work for God.  Store the mind
> with useful knowledge; ever reserving the first place for an
> industrious and prayerful study of the book of God.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

It is important to overcome these temptations by a *rule* of life fixed beforehand rather than trying to figure out what you will do in the moment of temptation. [[Rule of Life]]

This also connects with the idea of [[Self-Indulgence]] that started popping out to me while reading [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]].


#### Proverbs 10:4 ####
> A slack hand causes poverty,\
> but the hand of the diligent makes rich.

I think this general principle is true in spiritual matters just as it is in material:  People are poor in body, mind, and spirit because they approach work in all these areas with a limp heart and soon falter.  People become rich, by contrast, by throwing their whole being into the task at hand with vigor and commitment.  Many people lack spiritual riches because their hand is slack in acquiring them.

This law is a chief cause of envy in both the spiritual and the material realms.  The have-nots often look at the haves and burn with jealousy rather than look to the roots of the difference and their own responsibility in it.

> Justly the slothful man is condemned as deceitful; because he
> pretends to serve his Master, when in truth he has been doing
> nothing.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

This sounds like Billy's teaching on Ananias and Sapphira


#### Proverbs 10:5 ####
> He who gathers in summer is a prudent son,\
> but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who brings shame.

Bridges reads the fitting time to gather (harvest) as youth with respect to wisdom, but also the present age with respect to the lost (cf. Matthew 12:30, Christ is gathering right now and if we do not gather with him we are scattering).


#### Proverbs 12:11 ####
> Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread,\
> but he who follows worthless pursuits lacks sense.

I have received a lot from God and I must till it whatever the size.  My one-acre lot is this λόγος σοφίας that I must daily wake and plow until evening.  In this arrangement, I have the promise that I will not lack provision.  I will look to Him, open my mouth, and be satisfied.  By contrast, I can refuse to till.  I can chase after hollow things.  And by investing myself into them, starve.

More and more I realize that my little side pursuits are not really interesting.  In pursuing them, I lack sense because they lack sense.  I look up after hours and wonder, "what *was* all that?"  What kind of stupidity is this that continues to fiddle?


#### Proverbs 12:27 ####
> Whoever is slothful will not roast his game,\
> but the diligent man will get precious wealth.

A chief sign of sloth is the inability to carry a project through to the end.  The slothful man may go hunting but he will not cook what he has caught so as to make it useful to anyone, including himself.  By contrast, the diligent man produces resource that becomes a wellspring of blessing for those around him.

> How miserable and ruinous is the habit of sloth!  It is a dead
> palsy, under God only to be checked by early discipline and
> constant resistance.  Sometimes however the man makes a vigorous
> and successful effort.  He rouses himself even to the toil of
> hunting.  But his fit of exertion is soon over.  He cannot be at
> the pains of preparing his prey for his repast.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

In discipleship it is critical to note that the way to check sloth is "early discipline and constant resistance."  Fight early and keep fighting.

> Is not this a graphical picture of the slothful professor?  He
> will take up religion under a strong excitement.  He begins a new
> course, and perhaps makes some advances in it.  But "having no
> root in himself," his good frames and resolutions wither away.
> (Matthew 13:20)  The continued exertion required (Matthew 11:12);
> the violence that must be done to his deep-rooted habits; the
> difficulties in his new path; the invitations to present ease;
> the delusive hope of better success at a future day---all these
> hang as a weight upon his efforts.  So that, not knowing the only
> secret of resistance to his powerful enemy---earnest and
> persevering prayer; he grows slack, and with just life enough to
> feel himself dying, he sits down upon his little attainments;
> thus virtually throwing them away; content to lose heaven itself,
> if it is to be gained at such a cost.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

Bridges is right to connect this verse with the second kind of seed in the parable of the sower.  Self-indulgence kills the spiritual plant before it gets a chance to set down roots.  There may be a burst of effort, but not enough to establish lasting fruit.

The way to overcome this is "earnest and persevering prayer."

> The enfeebling influence of doubts and fears often arises, not
> from a deep feeling of corruption, but from an indolent habit,
> and a want of realized conviction of the infinite stake of the
> soul, calling for instant and persevering labour.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]


#### Proverbs 13:4 ####
> The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing,\
> while the soul of the diligent is richly supplied.

Interesting connection between sloth and craving.  I don't think the point here is merely that both the sluggard and the diligent man have desires with the latter fulfilled and the former not.  Instead, I think that the attitude of sloth actually *increases* craving because the sluggard simply sits around with nothing to do but fantasize about what he wants and does not have.  Holding these imaginings before the mind drives craving to the point of madness.  By contrast, the diligent man is so occupied with his labor that he looks up from the plow pleasantly surprised that some desire has been satisfied that he did not know he had.

> The sluggard desires the gain of diligence, without the diligence
> that gains.  He would be wise without study, and rich without
> labour.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

> False humility---a cover for indolence---must not hinder the
> faithful discharge of our trust.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]


#### Proverbs 14:23 ####
> In all toil there is profit,\
> but mere talk tends only to poverty.

Most translations add "mere" to the literal "word of the lips."  Surely, a God who gives us the scriptures and a wise man who gives us proverbs cannot condemn all words.  Nevertheless, as a man whose calling is in the λόγος σοφίας, I must pay careful attention to the danger and potential emptiness that my words may bring.  I should ask myself in many situations: Am I talking without toil?  Am I simply multiplying words that bring spiritual poverty?  Would it not be better right now to be silent?

We can also reverse the proverb by *modus tollens*: Where there is no fruit it must not be real toil; where there is wealth there must be more going on than mere talk.


#### Proverbs 15:19 ####
> The way of a sluggard is like a hedge of thorns,\
> but the path of the upright is a level highway.

I can confirm this by experience.  Whenever I give in to sloth I increasingly feel a painful wall in front of me, preventing me from moving forward at all.  By contrast, whenever I throw myself into the work that God has called me to do things become easier and easier as I gain momentum.

There is something paradoxical in this: often the motivation for being slothful is that I do not want things to be difficult.  I want to relax a little and just coast.  In reality, however, the way of sloth becomes harder and harder, more and more painful as the path grows full of piercing thorns.  When I give myself to the present pain of effort, I become increasingly happy and free.

When the devil approaches with the temptation, "why don't you take your ease for a little while?" the best response will be to quote this word of God in his face, knowing that the devil's ease is the very opposite of ease.

Notice that here the sluggard is not contrasted with the diligent but rather with the upright.

I wonder if the levelness of the upright's path has something to do with a freedom from the dramatic ups and downs of mood or inconsistency in general.  The sluggard is susceptible to every wind of change because he has adopted a passive, supine stance, whereas the upright, by actively pursuing obedience to God obtains continuity, stability and peace.

> Industrious wisdom performs what lazy foolishness deemed
> impossible.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

> Prize every particle of success obtained by exertion.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]


#### Proverbs 16:3 ####
> Commit your work to the LORD,\
> and your plans will be established.

With all the promises that accompany work, it may be easy to think of my work as *for myself*.  Rather, it must be given over to the Lord as a whole burnt offering.  Only then will the task become established on firm grounding.

We also see a dimension of entrusting the future of our projects into his hands.  We may plan for the future in prudence, but we must give no anxious care to tomorrow because we *trust* our Father.  There is a promise: your plans *will* be established when they are given to him.  Perhaps they will not turn out the way we thought or wanted at first, but if He is doing the establishing, then they will be good.


#### Proverbs 16:26 ####
> A worker's appetite works for him;\
> his mouth urges him on.

Compare 2 Thessalonians 3:10--13:

> For even when we were with you, we would give you this command:
> If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.  For we hear
> that some among you walk in idleness, not busy at work, but
> busybodies.  Now such persons we command and encourage in the
> Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own
> living.  As for you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good.

God has implanted in our very nature a remedy for the ever-worsening cycle of sloth: sheer hunger.  Thus we have grace in the combination of a few spiritual laws:

1. Fruit comes reliably if and only if one works.
2. In the absence of fruit, hunger.
3. Sheer hunger provides a motivation deeper than the love of
   idleness even in the very wicked.

We see this grace at work in the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:14--18):

> And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that
> country, and he began to be in need.  So he went and hired
> himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him
> into his fields to feed pigs.  And he was longing to be fed with
> the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything.  But
> when he came to himself, he said, "How many of my father's hired
> servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with
> hunger!  I will arise and go to my father, and say to him..."


#### Proverbs 18:9 ####
> Whoever is slack in his work\
> is a brother to him who destroys.

I have had the thought in fits of sloth, "At least I am not doing anything  wrong.  At least I am not hurting anyone."  But this is complete delusion.  The man that wastes his days---the man that the church needs---is by his absence little by little *destroying* the edifice that he ought to help build.

Further, the phrase, "slack in his work" implies that our man *is* working only doing a shoddy job of it.  He does it with slumped shoulders and a whine.  Such "work" is actually harm.  The building he makes will break in a few days leaving behind the trouble of cleaning up the pieces.  The slack worker creates more work for his fellows than one who simply does not work at all.

> Servant of Christ! let thy Master's life be thy pattern and thy
> standard.  Not a moment with him was slothfully neglected; not a
> moment unprofitably wasted.  Equally fervent was he in daily
> work, as in nightly prayer.  Follow him in his work, and thou
> wilt be honoured with his reward.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]


#### Proverbs 19:15 ####
> Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep,\
> and an idle person will suffer hunger.

Being slothful makes it more and more difficult to break out of sloth because the mind grows torpid and unresponsive to the protests of conscience.  Because my work is mental I have often thought that a little sleep and a little slumber would make my mind sharp again, but the exact opposite is the case.  By indulging in a little sloth, the mind grows thick and resistant to difficult thoughts rather than refreshed and renewed.

It is interesting that the sleep is "deep."  This is not the sleep that the Lord gives to his beloved, but rather a drugged sleep that leaves the sleeper more exhausted than he was before.

> All experience and observation attest the fact, that slothful
> habits destroy mental energy, and idleness is the road to want.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

> He has not the thorough use of his wakeful faculties.  And if he
> has (as who has not?) made a false step, there is no energy of
> effort to repair it.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

Sloth is a peculiar vice because it undermines something absolutely essential to overcoming any vice at all: manful effort.

#### Proverbs 19:24 ####
> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish\
> and will not even bring it back to his mouth.

Notice both the alliance but also the conflict between vices.  Sloth makes a man a glutton: in its constant pressure to turn him away from the discomfort of effort it tantalizes him with fantasies of self-indulgence.  Hence, the man who would not soil his hand at the plow buries it in a dish of sticky sweets.  But sloth also wars against gluttony because it robs its victim of the energy to complete even so slight a project as stuffing his face.  Further, as we have seen in previous proverbs, sloth ultimately destroys the ability of a man to get those fruits he most desires.

> [Sloth] so grows on its victim, that he has no heart to do even
> necessary things for himself; as if he could not take his hand
> out of his bosom; and would rather suffer the cravings of hunger,
> than make the exertion of putting his food into his mouth.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

In my own bouts of sloth I have noticed that the shirking of work inevitably leads to [[Acedia]].  I begin to neglect even basic hygiene or fixing myself meals.

> The special time for the resistance of this deadly disease, is
> when we are most under its power.  When the Bible is
> uninteresting as a common book, then is the time to live in it
> with patient diligence.  When prayer is cold and heartless,
> instead of giving up, hold on, however feebly, yet with
> perseverance.  When in a state of listless exertion, be employed
> for God and for his Church.  Form habits of early energy.  Beware
> of a dreaming sentimentalism.  Cultivate bodily activity.  Regard
> the incursions of sloth as the effects of those poisons, which,
> while they cause sleep, unless counteracted by constant
> resistance, must prove fatal.  Yet with all these means, never
> forget the one only principle, that makes them effectual---
> prayer, unceasing, believing "looking unto Jesus," who not only
> gives life, but liveliness (Hebrews 12:1--2, John 10:10).
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]


#### Proverbs 20:4 ####
> The sluggard does not plow in the autumn;\
> he will seek at harvest and have nothing.

KJV has:

> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold;\
> Therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.

Again, we see a link between sloth and procrastination.  There is an appropriate time for work when the reward is still a long way off.  Diligence requires that we put our hand to the plow with effort day after day rather than wait right up until the deadline.  If we neglect the appropriate time for plowing, we will become beggars when other people are reaping large crops, which in turn engenders a deep envy as we watch others happily eat the fruit we could have borne.

> The sluggard always has his excuses ready to shift off any work,
> that requires exertion.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]


#### Proverbs 20:13 ####
> Love not sleep lest you come to poverty;\
> open your eyes, and you will have plenty of bread.

There is a difference between sleeping---even enjoying it---because it restores you for the further service of God and becoming an addict of sleep itself, "loving" it for its own sake.

Notice how the promise of satisfaction that we see in other verses is here reduced to one simple action: just open your eyes.  In many ways this one action should be so easy to the sluggard since lifting your eyelids takes so little effort.  Yet this one action can be the hardest thing for the sluggard to do because it means forcefully stopping by an act of will the momentum of inactivity that we enjoy in sleep.

> I take it for granted that every Christian that is in health is
> up early in the morning; for it is much more reasonable to
> suppose a person up early because he is a Christian than because
> he is a laborer, or a tradesman, or a servant, or has business
> that wants him.
> [@law78 189]


#### Proverbs 20:21 ####
> An inheritance gained hastily in the beginning\
> will not be blessed in the end.

I included this verse because it seems to indicate that hasty work is not diligent work.  Although it gives the appearance of bearing fruit for a time, it collapses in the end.


#### Proverbs 21:5 ####
> The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance,\
> but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty.

As above, diligence is contrasted with haste.  This is important to realize because often when I come out of sloth I set to "work" by making a great show of activity trying to catch up on all the things I should have been doing while inactive.  True work is accomplished little by little, step by step, day after day, by the consistent application of effort.


#### Proverbs 21:17 ####
> Whoever loves pleasure will be a poor man;\
> he who loves wine and oil will not be rich.

Although this verse does not specifically mention sloth, it does mention the self-indulgent attitude that leads to it.  A preoccupation with feeling good leads straight to sloth because it leads away from effort.  That little discomfort that diligence's initial push requires will appear to the self-indulgent man an insurmountable cross.  Hence, the love of pleasure not only leads you to spend your money it also prevents you from getting any in the first place.

Notice that wine and oil are expensive luxuries.  An addiction to them undermines the very capacity to acquire them: the wealth that is the reward of diligence.  Poverty is unpleasant.  But chasing after the pleasant life drives you right into it.

> What then?  are we to have no pleasure?  This were indeed to
> drive men from religion.  Why---pleasure is the very character of
> the ways of God (Proverbs 3:17); pleasure infinitely more
> satisfying "than in the time that corn and wine increased."
> (Psalm 4:6--7)  Are we not, again, to rejoice in our earthly
> comforts?  "The living God giveth us richly all things to enjoy."
> (1 Timothy 6:17)  This large flow of happiness is more than
> doubled by the rule of "thanksgiving." (1 Timothy 4:4--5)  Yet,
> strange as it may seem, the way to enjoy pleasure is not to love
> it; to live above it;
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

> But the double-dealing professor asks---'May we not combine the
> two pleasures of the world and religion?'  But the object of the
> man of God is, first to awaken, then to satisfy, a holy appetite.
> And for this end he knows he must separate himself from all that
> mixture of worldly pleasure, which, while so far from quickening
> or nourishing, tends utterly to quench it.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]


#### Proverbs 21:25--26 ####
> The desire of the sluggard kills him,\
> for his hands refuse to labor.\
> all day long he craves and craves,\
> but the righteous gives and does not hold back.

We learned earlier (Proverbs 16:26) that hunger can drive us to work.  But what of the man whose sloth is too strong even for this (Proverbs 19:24)?  His hunger grows into a ceaseless craving that will eventually destroy him.

By contrast, the righteous, diligent man is able to give without restrain.  The sluggard becomes a black hole sucking in resources and yearning for more.  The righteous, however, becomes a fountain of blessing that continually overflows to others.

> He thinks to live by wishing, not be working.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

> Thus, dreaming of the end without mortification or godly
> exercise, he dies with his desires in his mouth; envying those,
> whose industrious diligence enables them to give, and spare not.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

> Effort is the death of sloth.  It sweeps away most, and endures
> the remaining difficulties, confident of ultimate success.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

> Deliberately devote yourselves.  Put the resolution into
> practical form, habit, and place.  Make all sacrifices for it.
> Seize all opportunities for making it good.  Our work will be our
> recompense; our labour our wages.  And while the slothful man
> only covets for himself, the righteous, in the flowing of the
> willing heart, lives for the Church.  He has to give, and he
> spares not.  "He is a blessing in the midst of the land."
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

*He lives for the Church*.  Relate this principle to the command in Ephesians 4:28:

> Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing
> honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to
> share with anyone in need.


#### Proverbs 22:13 ####
> The sluggard says, "There is a lion outside!\
> I shall be killed in the streets!"

I am constantly amazed by the absurdity of the excuses my own imagination will dream up when I don't want to work.  Behind the laughability of the excuse lies a serious dread: the beginning of effort means *death*.  The sluggard knows that if he leaves his little room he will be killed in the streets and this is not mere fancy.  *As a sluggard*, that is to say in his identification with the old man, he *will* die.

> Imaginary difficulties are the indulgence of sloth.  The slothful
> man is a coward.  He has no love for his work, and therefore he
> is always ready to put a cheat upon his soul, "inventing some

> every work likely to involve trouble.  Fancied dangers frighten
> him from real and present duties.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]


#### Proverbs 22:29 ####
> Do you see a man skillful in his work?\
> He will stand before kings;\
> he will not stand before obscure men.

I don't just want to stand before some king.  I want to stand before *the* King.  How much more, then, should I strive to be skillful in the work he has apportioned me?

Solomon here asks his son to notice and mark men that are skillful in their work.  Hence, we should not only try ourselves to be skillful but we should respect and notice the skill in the work of others.  Mark them: they will not always stand before obscure men.  Because the son addressed is the son of King Solomon, it is as if he were to say: "you see that man who is skillful in his work?  As a ruler you want to get *that* guy on your team.  If you don't, he will inevitably find his way to other courts."

> Diligence, even without godliness, is often the way to worldly
> advancement.  Pharaoh chose Joseph's brethren, as "men of

> Kings 11:28)
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]


#### Proverbs 24:30--34 ####
> I passed by the field of a sluggard,\
> by the vineyard of a man lacking sense,\
> and behold, it was all overgrown with thorns;\
> the ground was covered with nettles,\
> and its stone wall was broken down.\
> Then I saw and considered it;\
> I looked and received instruction.\
> A little sleep, a little slumber,\
> a little folding of the hands to rest,\
> and poverty will come upon you like a robber,\
> and want like an armed man.

Every time I read this scripture I am pierced by conviction.  My house, my time, and my mind are all broken down and overgrown with thorns.  Here is the irrefutable evidence of my sloth.

Notice that we can *look* and receive instruction in the looking when we *consider* the consequences of sin in the situations all around us.

> The stone wall, raised by some more industrious hand, is broken
> down; and he is too indolent to repair it.
> [@bridges59 ad loc.]

What the lazy man destroys by his negligence is *another man's* hard work.  This happens in the church.  After years of hard work, someone has handed to us a building to live in.  Merely by sitting with hands folded we can see it crumble.

> Not that he means to come to beggary.  He only wants yet a little
> sleep, a little slumber more---and then he will bestir himself.

> The slothful is satisfied, that his usefulness should never

#### Proverbs 26:13--16 ####
> The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the road!\
> There is a lion in the streets!"\
> As a door turns on its hinges,\
> so does a sluggard on his bed.\
> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;\
> it wears him out to bring it back to his mouth.\
> The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes\
> than seven men who can answer sensibly.

The sluggard on his bed is not sound asleep and he is not really comfortable: he keeps tossing and turning.  This back and forth movement, however, is not real movement in a settled direction.  It never gets anywhere.

Of course the sluggard is foolish, but why does he *think* he is so wise?  I have certainly seen this in my students: the worst are often the most confident.  Those who have never opened a book suppose that there is little they do not know.  Those, however, who have labored long and hard to acquire wisdom increase year by year their sense of how much remains beyond them.

#### Proverbs 28:19--20 ####
> Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread,\
> but he who follows worthless pursuits will have plenty of poverty.\
> A faithful man will abound with blessings,\
> but whoever hastens to be rich will not go unpunished.

I have been given a plot of land, a little portion in the earth from my Father, and it is my responsibility to work it.  This means faithfulness every morning; faithfulness over years; faithfulness through sacrifice.  The promise if I do this is unremitting sustenance.  I will have my fill in him.

On the other hand, many other paths lie open to me both on the right hand and on the left.  There are so many interesting things in the world and I can see what they are all about.  I can make any one of a million hollow things my pursuit.  The promise if I do is unremitting hollowness.

Notice that the idea of faithfulness is here contrasted with haste.  Things worth pursuing require long-term faithfulness and are not easily won.  This is why the sluggard finds worthless things to relieve the boredom.
