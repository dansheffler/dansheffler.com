## The Concept of the Kingdom in Matthew ##


- Three basic areas that help us to establish a comprehensive
  understanding of the kingdom concept: (i) living under the
  *authority* of a king, (ii) being subject to the *laws* of that
  kingdom, and (iii) being saturated by the *culture* of a kingdom.
- We will apply this knowledge by deepening out understanding of
  two key ideas in the New Testament: *gospel* and *salvation*.
  First, we can see the gospel as the *arrival of a new kingdom*,
  the return of a the rightful King.  Second, we can see salvation
  as a *transfer of citizenship from one kingdom to another*.


## Authority ##

- The Egyptians understood this concept and represented it with
  their pyramids.  The apex of the pyramid symbolizes the person of
  Pharaoh.  He unifies in his single lordship and authority with
  the rest of the hierarchy spreading out beneath him.  The whole
  pyramid is oriented toward that apex.  It receives its meaning,
  purpose, and structure from that singular point.  Pharaoh also
  embodies a gateway to the higher spiritual world above him, which
  in this case is the demonic kingdom.
- The "kingdom" of God implies a king, a Lord (κύριος = "master,"
  "person *in charge*"). I discussed this idea at greater length
  when I preached a few months ago on the Lordship of Christ
  ([2019-09-14 teaching][2019-09-14Teaching]).
- Lordship implies that a person has *authority* over a particular
  *dominion*.  In the New Testament ἐξουσία covers both of these
  meanings and is a key concept.  The basic idea is that a certain
  sphere of influence falls under a person (human, angel, or demon)
  and this person has a right to exercise control over this sphere.
  The person who really gets this concept is the Roman centurion in
  Matthew 8:8--9:

> But the centurion replied, "Lord, I am not worthy to have
> you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my
> servant will be healed. For I too am a man under
> authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, 'Go,'
> and he goes, and to another 'Come,' and he comes, and to
> my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."

- Over and over in Matthew, out attention is drawn explicitly to
  the authority Jesus has and the incredible extent of his domain.
  He has authority to forgive sins (9:6), he has authority over the
  Sabbath (12:8), and even over the physical elements of wind and
  waves (8:27).
- As the true source of authority over this domain, Jesus has the
  right to deputize agents underneath him.  These agents do not
  usurp or diminish his authority any more than an individual law
  enforcement officer diminishes the authority of the government.
  Rather the officer is an *extension of* that authority.  Jesus
  gives his disciples authority to cast out unclean spirits and
  heal *every* disease and affliction (10:1).  The gospel
  culminates in Jesus's statement that "all authority" has been
  given to him and the commissioning of the disciples under this
  authority (28:18--20).


## Laws ##

- Every kingdom has laws.  These laws constitute the basic
  framework that gives the kingdom its character.  A kingdom with
  unjust laws like Egypt will be a terrible place to live and the
  people who live there will be slaves to the tyrant.  Conversely,
  a kingdom with righteous laws will establish proper basis for
  people relating to each other.  In such a kingdom, the laws lead
  to a truly flourishing life.
- In the past few weeks we have discussed the idea of Moses as the
  law giver to the people of Israel at Mount Sinai.  In this way,
  Moses is a type of Christ, prefiguring the ultimate fulfillment
  of the divine Law that would come in Jesus.
- Throughout Matthew, we see Jesus giving this fulfillment of the
  Law as his issues decrees that up the ante of the Mosaic law and
  directly address the state of our heart.  The key phrase to look
  for is "...but I say to you..." which we see primarily in the
  Sermon on the Mount, but also scattered throughout the rest of
  the gospel.


## Culture ##

- Every kingdom has a unique culture, which we can pick up almost
  immediately when we land in the airport of a new country or get
  out of the car at a gas station on a long road trip.
- This culture is established by the character of the authority
  over this domain and by the laws that are in place to govern the
  way people act in this place.
- Culture frequently has less to do with specific ideas, doctrines,
  or behaviors and more to do with the feel or spirit back behind a
  way of life.  We all know what it is like to walk into the
  household of a particular family and notice a certain something,
  a way of being that we can't quite put our finger on or put into
  words but that we notice nonetheless.  This spirit in the
  household is closer to a smell or a flavor than it is to a
  definite piece of furniture or picture on the wall.  While
  specific philosophies, ideas, practices, or objects are *part* of
  a culture, we need to recognize that they frequently emerge from
  the background desires of the heart as it longs after and savors
  a particular aesthetic.
- This longing after a particular aesthetic is not neutral or
  blameless.  I become worried especially about some of the youth
  in our congregations (although I'm not surprised to see a
  rebellious attitude in older people too).  They want to debate
  whether it is "allowed" for Christians to watch a particular show
  or listen to a particular kind of music.  They feel like those in
  authority over them don't understand and are just mean and
  oppressive.  They want to push the boundaries of the "rules."
  They want to experiment with that trendy hairstyle---after all,
  what rule could they possibly be breaking with a hair style?  But
  the rules are besides the point.  What matters is that they are
  captured by a fascination with some aspect of the culture that
  they see "out there" in the world.  They are enamored by
  something that looks cool, trendy, different, exciting, or simply
  *not the way lame people do it around here*.  What matters is
  their heart.  They have no savor for the culture of the kingdom
  of God.  They have never even tried to discover what the flavor
  of *this* kingdom is and find *that* pleasing.  We need to call
  this what it is: a deeply wicked rebelliousness that derives from
  discontentment and a love of worldliness.  James is quite clear:
  "the friendship of the world is enmity with God" (4:4).
- We see this most often in kids that have never really lived in
  the world.  Those of us who grew up immersed in worldliness know
  this other kingdom for what it is: ugliness, selfishness,
  brokenness, bitterness, and evil--- the outer darkness away from
  the face of God.
- In a sermon on divorce from 2014-05-17 Billy gives the wonderful
  example of a school group going on a trip to Chicago or New York.
  The culture within the small little group is so markedly
  different from the culture of the surrounding city.  Imagine
  becoming separated from that group and the sense of desperation
  that you would feel cut off from its familiar culture.  Imagine
  after hours and hours *finally* finding your group again and
  knowing that once more you are safe, with people you can trust.
  This is the feeling of a person finally finding their way out of
  worldliness into the kingdom of God.


## Application ##

- We can now apply this richer understanding of what "kingdom"
  means to two specific areas:  How we preach the gospel and how we
  understand our salvation.

1. **Heaven to Earth**.  Jesus teaches us to pray "Thy kingdom
   come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" (Matthew
   6:10). This is a succinct expression of the gospel.  The good
   news is that we no longer need to live under the authority,
   laws, and culture of Pharaoh.  For too long men have lived under
   this Dark Kingdom.  Their lives have been under the tyranny of
   Satan. Their actions have been governed by the laws of lust,
   pride, greed, and envy.  Their culture stinks with the putrid
   rot of death.  The good news is that a new kingdom *has arrived*
   in the person of Jesus.  He is a new authority, he brings new
   laws, and we *can* live according to the new spirit of the
   culture that he brings here and now.  The first thing Jesus
   preaches is the arrival of this Kingdom (Matthew 4:17).
   Likewise, he instructs his disciples to go out proclaiming this
   new Kingdom (Matthew 10:7).  Consider for a moment how this
   might practically change the way you "share the gospel."
2. **Salvation**.  Relatedly, we can now see salvation as more than
   simply the forgiveness of sins and the promise of heaven
   eventually.  The Kingdom of Heaven is here.  Salvation means
   both "rescue" and "making whole again."  Jesus does this in our
   life by entering into the Dark Kingdom where we once lived and
   kidnapping us right from under Satan's nose.  In the words of
   Colossians, the Father has "delivered us from the domain of
   darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son"
   (1:13).  Take a second to think about how this should rework
   your understanding of your own salvation.  Can you identify the
   areas where demonic rule used to operate in your life?  Have you
   fully appropriated the freedom you can now have in Christ from
   that domain of darkness?  Consider the laws that used to govern
   your behavior.  Have you adopted a new set of laws?  Have you
   taken the time to learn those new laws and internalize them?
   Consider the culture that you used to walk in apart from God's
   kingdom.  Do you still savor some aspect of that culture and
   look back over your shoulder longingly like Lot's wife?  Have
   you fully embraced with joy the culture of the kingdom of
   heaven?
