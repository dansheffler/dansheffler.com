**Thesis Disputanda**: A central tenet of Platonic thinking is that human nature inherently contains an element (though not the whole) of the divine, which is our rationality (λογιστικόν, νοῦς).

## Polemical Implications of this Thesis ##

- Miller is wrong to think that the desire to *possess* the
  beautiful at the beginning of Diotima's discourse is
  problematized by the end.
- Miller is wrong to think that the hubris of human rationality in
  the first three speeches is problematized by Aristophanes and
  ultimately Socrates.  Rather, Socrates builds upon and goes
  further than these speeches.
- Annas's "unwordly" conception of the divine is fundamentally
  unreasonable, and recognized as such by Plato.
- Imitation (ὁμοίωσις) of the divine can be characterized as being
  true to our truest self.
- Conversely, knowledge of our true self can lead to (and in some
  sense already is) knowledge of the divine (cf. *Alcibiades* 130--
  138).
- Instead of Miller's "higher *other*" we should think of the
  orientation toward the Beautiful as an orientation toward a
  "higher *self*" (similar to Augustine's *interior intimo meo et
  superior summo meo*).


## Textual Starting Points ##

1. **Our Common Human Nature**: Universally, humans have an orientation toward good and beautiful things insofar as they are good and beautiful.  This reflects a trace of the Good and the Beautiful imprinted upon the human soul.  (Cf. recollection in the *Phaedo* and *Phaedrus*, Meno's paradox, the Kinship argument in the *Phaedo*.)

> But, she continued, supposing one substituted 'the good' for 'the
> beautiful' and put the question: 'Look, Socrates, I say to you,
> what does someone who loves good things love?'
> 
> Their becoming his, I answered.
> 
> And what does the fellow have who gets these good things?
> 
> That's easier, I responded.  I can answer that he has joy.
> 
> So, she concluded, by the possession of good things, happy people
> are happy, and there is no longer any need to ask why a man who
> wishes for happiness, wishes it.  Rather, this answer seems to be
> complete....But do you really think that such a desire and love
> are really common to all men, and that they all desire good
> things for themselves? (204e--205a)

This connects closely with a restriction that Socrates places on the type of soul that can enter a human organism in the myth of the *Phaedrus*:

> But a soul that never saw the truth cannot take a human shape
> (εἰς τόδε ἥξει τὸ σχῆμα), since a human being must understand
> speech in terms of general forms, proceeding to bring many
> perceptions together into a reasoned unity (δεῖ γὰρ ἄνθρωπον
> συνιέναι κατ᾽ εἶδος λεγόμενον, ἐκ πολλῶν ἰὸν αἰσθήσεων εἰς ἓν
> λογισμῷ συναιρούμενον). (249c)


2. **Μεταξύ**:  When they assume that love *is* beautiful because it is *of* what is beautiful, Phaedrus and Agathon are not altogether wrong.  The position of Socrates and Diotima is not a *radical* break from the old Greek axiom that "like knows like" (or Agathon's version "like likes like"; 195c).  It is rather a qualification and refinement of it.  Afterall, what is altogether *without* wisdom could hardly know to seek it.  So too, what is altogether without beauty could not desire it.  This is represented by Eros's father, Resource.

> ...according to my theory [Eros] couldn't be either beautiful or
> good.
> 
> How can you say that, Diotima?  I demanded.  Can Love then be
> ugly and evil?
> 
> But she said, Be quiet (οὐκ εὐφημήσεις;)![^5y]  Do you think that
> whatever isn't beautiful must necessarily be ugly?...Then don't
> insist on the thing which isn't beautiful being ugly, or on the
> thing which isn't good being evil.  And when you can bring
> yourself to agree that Love is neither good nor beautiful, it
> won't be necessary anymore for him to be ugly and evil.  Rather
> he is between these, she said.
> (201e--202b)

  [^5y]: Eὐφημέω has a religious and pious coloring, i.e. "observe a holy silence" or "avoid words of bad omen that may offend the gods."
