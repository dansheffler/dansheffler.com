## Qualitative Evaluation ##

The following student responses are selected from a department questionnaire.  I tried to pick samples that are representative of recurring student sentiments. 


"[If you were teaching this course, what would you do differently?] I'd resign and have Mr. Sheffler teach it so students could have a better education."

"I was never bored.  Instead he woke me up and dragged me into philosophy."

"The class was structured very nicely because there was lecture and discussion.  Our professor called on students so everyone had to participate."

"He encourages everyone to participate and voice their opinions.  The instructor is very knowledgeable about the material and presents it well."

"I liked how he encouraged student participation and made everyone feel comfortable to speak up."

"Dan was an excellent instructor and made some very complicated themes fairly simple, he always made himself available for help outside of the classroom, he will be a very good professor."

"Strengths include the informality of the course.  Instructor was not intimidating or rude.  Very helpful."

"The instructor's strengths were his ability to gauge student interest, answer questions effectively, and come across as caring about his students."

"Mr. Sheffler covered all the material efficiently and in a relaxed, easy manner that was conducive to my way of learning."

"[He is] very smart, very interesting/stimulating.  Great teacher.  Fair grader, encourages success.  No weaknesses."

"I gained a great deal of valuable opinions and views as well as thought provoking discussions.  [The instructor's strengths are] excellent knowledge, demeanor and preparedness."

"[He is] really good at making class enjoyable and carrying out discussions; has great knowledge of subject."
