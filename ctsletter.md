CTS Students,

We will be starting our Christian Training School on June 1---just three weeks away.  CTS is not a summer camp where kids get away to have fun.  Instead, it is a place where disciples of Jesus Christ set apart eleven weeks for the serious task of pressing into God's presence.  Just as you would prepare your heart before you take communion, you should be preparing your heart now to seek God this summer.

Each week will follow the same daily format Monday through Friday: programing between Breakfast and Lunch and programing after dinner with the afternoons left open:

--------------- -------------------------------------------------------
07:30 AM        Breakfast
08:00 AM        Prayer
09:00 AM        Group Bible Study
10:00 AM        Morning Teaching Session
12:00 AM        Lunch
06:00 PM        Dinner
07:00 PM        Evening Teaching
09:00 PM        Reflection
10:00 PM        Lights Out
--------------- -------------------------------------------------------

This means that each week there will be ten sessions on a single theme, usually by a single teacher:

--------------- ------------------- -----------------------------------

The trajectory of the summer will move from foundational teachings in the beginning to practical life issues in the Kingdom by the end.

A few bits of practical information:  All our meals will be communal.  The church has seen a few set-backs in acquiring the camp property you have heard so much about, so we will be starting CTS at the Jessamine Christian Fellowship building (where CTS was held last time).  If we can, we will transfer over to the new camp property as soon as possible.  In any case, we will provide beds, food, and silverware etc.  You should bring bedding, toiletries, clothes for eleven weeks, notebook, pen, and Bible.

A huge aspect of CTS is our spirit of fasting and spiritual discipline aimed at seeking the Face of God.  To this end, we will all participate in a few group-wide disciplines, but I want to emphasize at the outset that the spirit matters more than the letter.  There are things that you will decide to give up for the summer personally because they distract *you* from seeking God even though they seem to be fine for everyone else.  As a group we will be fasting from all forms of entertainment, including movies, music, television, novels, Facebook, and Instagram.  Along with all the CF churches, we will also fast from food until dinner on Wednesdays.  We will have communal Bible and prayer every day, but we also encourage private Bible and prayer every day during the afternoons and after the evening teaching.  We will be cultivating a spirit of quiet by using our words to give grace to those who hear them.  We will have assigned (short) readings in theology and devotion throughout the week and discussions on these at dinner.  We will cultivate memorization of and meditation on scripture.  Finally, we will practice the discipline of manual labor together as we grow vegetables and (hopefully) work on our camp property.

I'm looking forward to pressing into God with all of you this summer.  I already have the sense that His Spirit will be thick upon us.  Begin now to cry out to Him for a deeper measure of grace for us all.
